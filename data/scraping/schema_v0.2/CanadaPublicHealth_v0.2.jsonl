Some of the physical distancing measures need extensive preparation. Community planners should prepare for: \ninterruptions in social supports\nreduction in public services like transit and access to community centres\nfinancial consequences from the reduction of services or cancelled events\nPlanners, administrators and employers must work together to put into effect community-based measures to protect:\ngroups\nemployees\nthe general population \n\nAvoiding crowds\nRespiratory illnesses like COVID-19 spread quickly in crowded spaces. Avoiding crowds can reduce the spread of infection. This type of precaution could have a significant impact on how a community functions. \nCommunities should plan ahead and consider:\n\nwhether to shut down public transit\r\n\t\t\t\nif public transit is shut down, ensure transportation remains available for:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ncritical infrastructure workers\nemergency medical services or treatments like dialysis and chemotherapy\n\n\n\n\nworking with employers and businesses to put into effect staggered work hours\r\n\t\t\t\nthis reduces crowding on public transit during peak commuting hours and in large workplaces during normal workday hours\n\n\nvoluntary quarantine of a community based on a risk assessment\nwhether to ask individuals, organizations and businesses to cancel or postpone mass gatherings, such as:\r\n\t\t\t\nfunerals\nweddings\nreligious services\nconcerts, conferences, sporting events and other forms of entertainment\n\n\nrequiring people to stay home from school, work or other community settings, such as shopping centres and movie theatres\n\n\nMass gatherings\nMass gatherings can have the potential for serious public health consequences if they are not planned and managed carefully. They can increase the spread of infectious diseases and cause additional strain on the health care system when held during outbreaks.\nInfections can also be transmitted during transit to and from an event, and in participants' home communities upon return.\nOrganizers need to consider the COVID-19 outbreak in their event planning and follow recommendations to cancel or postpone gatherings of 50 people or more. This number may be lower in some jurisdictions. Organizers should consult their local public health authorities who may set other criteria depending on specific circumstances.\nAside from cancelling or postponing an event, other measures to reduce infection risks during mass gatherings include:\n\navoiding shaking hands\npractising proper hygiene\navoiding common sleeping areas\ndiscouraging attendees from sharing food or drinks\nincreasing physical distance between others (ideally to 2 metres) by:\r\n\t\t\t\nbroadcasting events\noffering virtual participation \nmoving the venue from indoors to outdoors\n\n\neliminating self-serve buffet style eating at social or religious gatherings\nencouraging ill people and people who are at risk for severe illness not to attend gatherings\nsupporting hand hygiene by providing hand sanitizers dispensers in prominent locations\nensuring event organizers have arrangements in place to safely isolate and transport people who become ill onsite\ncommunicating clearly to attendees about the risks and directing them to our advice on reducing the spread of illness \n\nFor more information, refer to our COVID-19 guidance on risk-informed decision making for mass gatherings. \n\nRemote and isolated communities\nCommunities that are remote or isolated should consider stocking up on needed supplies like food and medicine. The supply chain may be interrupted or become unreliable.\nAdditional challenges should be taken into account. For example, some remote communities may have limited access to clean running water for frequent hand hygiene.\n\nFor Indigenous communities\nRefer to coronaviruses in Indigenous communities for more information on preparing for an outbreak of COVID-19. \n\nOrganizations who serve those experiencing homelessness\nThose who experience homelessness may be at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 or developing complications due to COVID-19. This is because they may not be able to access and use traditional services and standard resources. \nOrganizations, community health workers and volunteers play an important role in helping prevent the spread of COVID-19 among those who experience homelessness.
