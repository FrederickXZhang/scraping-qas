This offers information on local organizations that can provide advice to renters in distress. \nLoans and credit Many consumer lenders are offering affected customers help if they can’t make payments.

Donor blood is not being used to treat coronavirus patients, but transfusions are still needed for cases like organ transplants or complications of childbirth.\nBut thousands of community blood drives have been canceled, cutting short a crucial supply. \nThe American Red Cross is still collecting donations at blood banks, which have enacted new safety measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Those measures include checking the temperatures of staff members and donors before they enter a drive facility, providing hand sanitizer for use before and during the donation process, enhancing their disinfection of surfaces and equipment, and spacing beds — when possible — to enable social distancing between donors.\nAnd even if you’re under a stay-at-home order, donating blood is an essential need, so public health officials have made an exception for your trip to the donation center. \nTo find a donation center, check the American Association of Blood Banks locator, visit the Red Cross website or call 1-800-RED-CROSS.\n\n Read More\n            \n              Here’s how to donate blood during the outbreak.", "questionUUID": "ed74c034-7b41-11ea-9e71-8c85901aafa7", "answerUUID": "ed74c142-7b41-11ea-9d73-8c85901aafa7", "ID": "NYTimes|||-2155892769216127544", "answerContainsURLs": false, "answerToks2URL": {}}

Officials are telling us to stay indoors and away from others. At the same time, you need food or, as importantly, medicine. But what about the health of the delivery workers who come to your door? How do we keep each other safe?\nFor older Americans and those with health problems who are most at risk if they contract the coronavirus, having goods delivered makes sense. Some companies, like Postmates and Instacart, have begun offering non-contact or curbside deliveries. European companies are doing it, too.\nThose services have a large network in place, though, which means their businesses are likely to thrive. Smaller retailers will not as Americans eschew restaurants, bars and specialty stores. That is why some restaurants are promoting delivery services as a way to stay in business, and why some cities that have ordered restaurants and bars to close have made exceptions for places providing delivery and takeout.\nBut what about delivery workers? Some groups, like Gig Workers Rising, are demanding that employers like Doordash and Instacart do more to protect them on the job. Recently, the group started a petition asking companies to provide paid time off to drivers who become sick during the coronavirus outbreak and cannot work.\nThe bottom line is this: Online deliveries are a boon for those who cannot leave their homes, as well as small restaurants who fear going out of business. But at the same time it comes with a risk to drivers and delivery workers who fear the loss of income if they get sick. At a minimum, everyone should generously tip their drivers for the service.\n\n Read More\nRead an essay in our Opinion section by a food-delivery driver.", "questionUUID": "ed769f3a-7b41-11ea-924b-8c85901aafa7", "answerUUID": "ed76a098-7b41-11ea-9d84-8c85901aafa7", "ID": "NYTimes|||-1549751123454998618", "answerContainsURLs": false, "answerToks2URL": {}}
