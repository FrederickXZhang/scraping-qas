Convalescent plasma is the liquid part of blood that is collected from patients who have recovered from the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 patients develop antibodies in the blood against the virus. Antibodies are proteins  that might help fight the infection. Convalescent plasma is being investigated for the treatment of COVID-19 because there is no approved treatment for this disease and there is some information that suggests it might help some patients recover from COVID-19. Further investigation is still necessary to determine if convalescent plasma might shorten the duration of illness, reduce morbidity, or prevent death associated with COVID-19.

How are people tested for COVID-19?	A. To be tested for COVID-19, a sample is typically collected from your nose and/or throat with a special swab at a designated collection location staffed by health care professionals. Currently, a health care professional swabbing the back of the nasal cavity through the nostril is the preferred choice. Alternatively, the health care professional may swab the back of your throat, or for patients with symptoms of COVID-19, the inside of the front of the nose. Depending on, among other things, the type of swab used, a health care professional may collect the sample, or you may be able to collect the sample yourself at the collection site under the supervision of health care personnel. Testing of the sample is performed in a laboratory on the prescription or order of a health care professional.

"At this time, the FDA has not authorized any COVID-19 test to be completely used and processed at home. However, on April 20, 2020, the FDA authorized the first COVID-19 test for home collection of samples to be sent to a laboratory for processing and test reporting. Please note that this authorization is specific only to the test that has been issued the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), which has a home collection option (LabCorp’s COVID-19 RT-PCR Test). Any COVID-19 test intended for at-home testing, including self-collection of a sample at home, with or without the use of telemedicine, must be authorized by the FDA. The FDA sees the public health value in expanding the availability of COVID-19 testing through safe and accurate tests that may include home collection, and we are actively working with test developers in this space. You can find listings of tests that have have been issued an EUA on the Emergency Use Authorizations page.
The FDA is supportive of at-home testing for COVID-19 if there is data and science to support consumer safety and test accuracy. We are actively working with developers on EUAs for at-home tests that demonstrate appropriate validation. Home collection raises several issues of importance, including whether the lay user can safely and properly collect the sample, whether the components of the test kit are safe for use in the home environment (since some components may be toxic), proper shipment, and stability of the sample (such as, if the sample sits in a hot truck). A physician watching the collection via telemedicine may address the issue of sample collection (if the self-collection method does not raise safety concerns), but telemedicine does not address these other issues."

"There are currently two types of tests available for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Molecular tests detect the virus and can be used to directly diagnose COVID-19 and antibody tests detect the body’s immune response to the infection caused by the virus but cannot be used to definitively diagnose or exclude COVID-19. Currently, molecular tests are the only type of tests that can be used alone to diagnose COVID-19. Antibody tests cannot be used alone to rule out COVID-19.
Molecular Tests: “Nucleic acid amplification tests,” or “NAAT” tests are molecular tests that detect the virus’s genetic material. FDA has issued Emergency Use Authorizations (EUA) for dozens of molecular tests. Based on current data, we believe these EUA-authorized tests are highly accurate tests.
Antibody Tests: Antibody (or serology) tests detect antibodies in the blood when the body is fighting an infection. The test does not detect the actual virus; rather, it detects the body’s immune response to the virus. In the early days of an infection, antibodies may not be detected, limiting the effectiveness of an antibody test. This type of test may also be falsely positive if antibodies to a coronavirus other than the pandemic novel strain are present. Because of this potential for false negative and false positive results, an antibody test should not be used alone to diagnose COVID-19. FDA has also issued EUAs for serology tests to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. More information on serology tests can be found in the Serology section of FAQs on Diagnostic Testing for SARS-CoV-2."

Antibody tests cannot be used alone to rule out COVID-19. However, they can serve an important role. Using antibody tests on many patients may help the medical community better understand the immune response in patients over time and how many people may have been infected. In the future, it is also possible that they may also be used to help determine, together with other clinical data, that some individuals are no longer susceptible to infection. In addition, these test results can aid in determining who may donate a part of their blood called convalescent plasma, which may serve as a possible treatment for those who are seriously ill from COVID-19.

"We currently don’t fully understand how COVID-19 affects different animal species. We are aware of a very small number of pets, including dogs and cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 after close contact with people with COVID-19. 
On April 22, 2020, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced the first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) infection in two pet cats. These are the first pets in the United States to test positive for SARS-CoV-2. The cats lived in two separate areas of New York state. Both had mild respiratory illness and are expected to make a full recovery. SARS-CoV-2 infections have been reported in very few animals worldwide, mostly in those that had close contact with a person with COVID-19. 
A tiger at a zoo in New York has also tested positive for the virus; it was the first confirmed case of COVID-19 infection in an animal in the United States. 
Recent research shows that ferrets, cats, and golden Syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with the virus and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings. Pigs, chickens, and ducks did not become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies. Data from one study suggest that dogs are not as likely to become infected with the virus as cats and ferrets. These findings were based upon a small number of animals and do not indicate whether animals can spread infection to people."

This avoids placing additional stresses on human testing resources while also recognizing the potential importance of animal testing to supporting public health. 
Although animal and human tests are generally similar, this type of testing has to be adjusted in each species and for each sample type (blood, feces, nasal swab). Human and animal tests are not intended to be interchangeable.

"Yes. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some coronaviruses like COVID-19 cause cold-like illnesses in people, while others cause illness in certain types of animals, such as cattle, camels, and bats. Some coronaviruses, such as canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals and do not infect humans. For example, bovine coronavirus causes diarrhea in young calves, and pregnant cows are routinely vaccinated to help prevent infection in calves. This vaccine is only licensed for use in cattle for bovine coronavirus and is not licensed to prevent COVID-19 in cattle or other species, including humans.
Dogs can get a respiratory coronavirus, which is part of the complex of viruses and bacteria associated with canine infectious respiratory disease, commonly known as “kennel cough.” While this virus is highly contagious among both domestic and wild dogs, it is not transmitted to other animal species or humans.
Most strains of feline enteric coronavirus, a gastrointestinal form, are fought off by a cat’s immune system without causing disease. However, in a small proportion of these cats, the virus can cause feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a disease that is almost always fatal.
Other species, like horses, turkeys, chickens, and swine, can contract their own species-specific strains of coronavirus but, like the other strains mentioned above, they are not known to be transmissible to humans. More information is available in the American Veterinary Medical Association’s fact sheet about coronaviruses in domestic species."

Preliminary results from a placebo-controlled clinical trial of remdesivir by the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases suggested that patients taking remdesivir experienced faster time to recovery as compared to patients taking a placebo. Preliminary results from a Phase 3 trial evaluating 5-day and 10-day dosing durations of remdesivir in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 disease, but most of whom were not receiving mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) at baseline, reported that patients receiving a 10-day treatment course achieved similar improvement as those taking a 5-day treatment course. The safety and efficacy of remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 are being evaluated in multiple ongoing clinical trials.
Because remdesivir may possibly help very sick patients, FDA is allowing this drug to be provided to hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) issued May 1, 2020.

Often, there are comparisons between COVID-19 and influenza because the symptoms are somewhat similar and because COVID-19 started to emerge in the winter, which is the same time of the year when we see influenza. But when it comes to immunity, there's a very big difference between influenza and COVID-19. With influenza, because of previous infections and vaccinations, there's always a percentage of the population that is immune to infection—so they're protected and won't get the flu that year. And there's an even larger percentage of the population that has some immunity—not perfect immunity, so you'll still get infected, but enough so that your symptoms will be relatively mild.

We don't have a good answer for that yet. It certainly seems that people over the age of 60, particularly those with secondary medical conditions, are at greater risk for severe disease. We're beginning to understand that men may also be at increased risk. We're seeing these trends pretty consistently across different countries. What we don't know yet is why. That's a really important area of research that my colleagues at Hopkins are working on. If we could better understand what's happening in high-risk populations to make them more susceptible, it could inform development of treatments for severe disease.

A lot of respiratory viruses have a seasonality. In areas that have seasons, you often see more respiratory disease in the winter than in the summer. That's because the conditions of lower temperature and lower humidity help facilitate transmission of the virus. COVID-19 is entering the population during the winter but we don't know if it's going to act like a typical respiratory virus in terms of seasonality. We don't know if COVID-19 will be very dependent on winter to effectively transmit, like the flu, or if it will find ways to effectively transmit throughout the year.

I think that's a major concern. Nearer term, I'm concerned about what will happen if public health interventions are loosened. Right now, public health interventions are doing a good job of reducing the number of cases, but we don't know how long we will have to keep those measures in place. When we relieve them, there is always a potential for cases to spike again.

We're trying to understand how this virus is able to cause many more cases of mild disease compared to other viruses. We think that may be linked to why it's so good at transmitting. We're also trying to understand, once you've had the virus, whether you're safe to go out and work again because you have some level of protection.

Self-isolation would be isolating within the house after you start showing symptoms of COVID-19. Social distancing is a response in which people remain home and distant from others (such as by refraining from shaking hands or hugging or going to the store at off hours), without any known exposure to the virus, to limit possible transmission to or from others.

If you can have a separate space for the sick person—a space where they can access the restroom without traveling through commons spaces—that would be best. Those who are caring for loved ones who are sick at home should wash their hands frequently, avoid close contact as much as possible, and have the sick individual wear a surgical or procedure mask to prevent droplets spreading through the air. It is also important to clean frequent- or high-touch surfaces, as well to clean clothes in very hot water. Caregivers should also wear a mask, if possible.

I think that's a tougher situation. It's very hard to stay away from kids, especially when they're ill and need care and comfort. If possible, main caregivers should be those who are not at high risk from COVID-19, meaning those not over age sixty or with underlying health issues.

In general, it's important to keep the circle smaller. At the moment, not exposing yourself to many additional people is best. Healthcare workers, people with critical jobs, and hourly employees who have to work will need to rely on childcare providers. In those situations, you may ask someone you know and trust, and who is reliable in taking the social distancing rules seriously.

This includes care in the emergency room, at community and migrant health centers, free clinics, and public hospitals. 
If you have CAWEM, CAWEM plus, OHP,
or private insurance, you won’t be charged for a test or treatment for COVID-19, including going to the hospital. 
The Governor has reached an agreement with insurers so that people will not have to pay anything out of pocket for COVID-19 tests or hospitalizations from COVID-19.
If you are undocumented or have been a legal permanent resident (green card holder) for less than 5 years, you may be eligible for the Oregon Health Plan’s (OHP) Citizen/Alien Waived Emergency Medical (CAWEM) benefit which includes emergency medical, dental and transport services including services at a hospital emergency room and being
hospitalized if needed. CAWEM also includes all services for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. This coverage is not limited to emergency rooms and hospitals. OHA can reimburse providers for COVID-19-related services regardless of service location. Coverage includes non-emergency settings such as medical offices and urgent care.

The receipt of emergency Medicaid, such as CAWEM, cannot be counted under U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service’s (USCIS) public charge rule. Additionally, on March 13, 2020 USCIS issued an alert on its website stating​ that the agency will not consider testing, treatment, or preventive care (including vaccines, if a vaccine becomes available) related to COVID-19 as part of a public charge determination. You should seek the medical treatment or preventive services you need to protect your health and the health of others. This includes if your care is paid for in whole or in part by Medicaid, also known as the Oregon Health Plan. 
If you do not have Oregon Health Plan (OHP) coverage or Citizen/Alien Waived Emergency Medical (CAWEM), you can apply for it here​. If you don’t want to sign up for OHP because of the public charge rule, you can see a clinician through your county health clinic or through a federally qualified health clinic (FQHC). If you have any important medical, mental health or medication needs be sure to mention this when you call.

"During this time of increased stress, it’s important to
prioritize your mental well-being. Our lives have been disrupted in ways both
large and small. Be gentle with yourself, adjust your expectations and allow
yourself time to get used to the new normal. 
It’s OK if you are struggling to adapt or if you are feeling
fearful or sad. These are natural reactions to an unusual situation. If you
feel this way, reaching out to others can help. Try to build some social
connection into your regular routine – it’s best not to wait for sadness or
loneliness to set in, since sometimes that can make it harder to reach out. 
You can help others while you help yourself: check in regularly with friends and neighbors
to offer support, especially to those who might be struggling more during this
time.
Older adults, people who experience disabilities, parents
with young children, and those living with mental health or substance abuse
challenges might be feeling especially isolated right now. If there is someone
in your life who you think might need a little extra connection, reach out to
them.
It’s natural to struggle with feelings of sadness,
frustration, fear, or anxiety during this time of increased isolation. Some
additional tools that some have found helpful to cope with these feelings
include:
Guided
relaxation, meditation, or mindfulness exercises  
Physical exercise
Writing in a journal
Creative expression like singing or making music, creative
writing, or 
Creating artwork
If you’re struggling now with your behavioral health, you are
not alone. Help is available, please reach out. Find resources in the
behavioral health section of the OHA COVID-19 page.
If you need support or just want someone to talk to, there
are many resources available. Find resources in the behavioral health section
of the OHA
COVID-19 page.
If you need behavioral health services, telehealth care is
available. Your health care providers may provide care to you using telephone
or video platforms. This way, you can get the care you need while staying home.
Contact your care provider or your health plan to learn more.
Staying active is good for your mind and your body. Outdoor
exercise, alone or with your household members, can be a fun way to relax and
can help combat sad or anxious feelings. You can also exercise in your own
home, alone or with online classes like yoga or Zumba."

If you are well, limit in-person visits to the pharmacy.
Plan to order and pick up all your prescriptions at the same time.
If possible, call prescription orders in ahead of time. Use drive-thru windows, curbside services (wait in your car until the prescription is ready), mail-order, or other delivery services. Do the same for pet medicine.
Check with your doctor and pharmacist to see if you can get a larger supply of your medicines so you do not have to visit the pharmacy as often.

your children safe. Lock up guns and medications even if you trust your child or teen and feel they are safe. It only takes a moment for someone to hurt themselves in a temporary moment of despair or anger.
Remember,
children follow the lead of their parents. They look to you to see if they
should be afraid, concerned, confident, calm or carefree. You can set the stage
for their response to be concerned and confident by taking a moment to check in
with yourself before you check in with them. 
Consistency
and structure can help establish a sense of normalcy and be calming. 

Try to establish a simple routine for your
family in 60- or 90-minute chunks.
Get your children involved in the planning
process to give them a sense of control. 
Consider including routine mealtimes and
consistent bedtimes and wake up times.
Physical activity has been shown to combat symptoms of anxiety and depression.
Taking regular breaks to go outside for fresh
air and exercise is great for mental health.
Look for free online resources for
youth-focused at-home workouts, such as Fitness Blender Kids Workout - 25
Minute Fun Workout for Kids at Home.

Relearn
how to be present with your family. 

Being present and available for your family
can be the best way to support and help during this stressful time. 
Consider working on tasks or projects
alongside your children and set aside time to offer your family your full and
undivided attention.

Maintain
technologic well-being:

The key to healthy screen use is awareness and
open conversations with your children. 
Consume news judiciously from reputable
journalism organizations, the Oregon Health Authority or
the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention. 
Participate in technology alongside your
children, for example by engaging with them via social media apps or video
games they frequently use.

"​If a healthcare
provider thinks you may have COVID-19, he or she will first determine if you
are well enough to stay home or if you need to go to a clinic or hospital. Healthcare
providers may also work with local public health to arrange for testing for the
virus. 
Testing​ will likely involve:

A nose swab and throat swab.
A routine blood sample.
Coughing up mucus, if possible.



If you are
seen in a clinic or hospital, your health care provider may ask you to:

Put on a mask to limit spread of the virus.
Make sure you are not around other people.


Care
providers may:

Show you to a private room.
Put on equipment to protect themselves such as:
gowns,
gloves,
eye protection, and
s​pecial masks.






There is no
specific treatment for COVID-19. The goal is to support the person who is ill,
supply oxygen if needed, and help lessen the symptoms until the immune system
kicks in and kills the virus. Most people with COVID-19 appear to have mild
disease that doesn’t require a medical visit. 
As with flu, most people can recover at home without problems. Those
with fever and cough who get significant trouble breathing, or feel faint, or parents
of a child who gets bluish color of the skin around the mouth should call promptly
and arrange for medical evaluation or call 911.
If you are
tested for COVID-19, staff from your local health department will call you.
They will ask you for details about recent travel and people you have been
around. Your care providers and public health staff will give you information
about how to keep from spreading the virus to your family and friends."

"Encourage sick employees to stay home.
Health experts recommend that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay home. Employees should not come to work if they have:
Fever (100.4° F [38° C] or greater using an oral thermometer).
Other symptoms like cough, vomiting, or diarrhea.
People should be without fever or cough for 72 hours without using fever reducing medicines like aspirin or acetaminophen before returning to work or school. This applies to everyone, not just people that have been tested for COVID-19.
Employees should inform their supervisor and stay home if they are sick.
Separate sick employees from other employees.
This is what CDC recommends. Also, those with fever or acute respiratory illness symptoms should go home immediately:
Upon arrival to work, or
During the day, if symptoms develop while at work.
Help your workplace stay healthy.
Emphasize that all employees should:
Stay home when sick, and make sure workplace policies allow sick
leave so that people can do the right thing by protecting their co-workers.
Cover their coughs and sneezes.
Wash their hands frequently.
For more information visit these CDC websites:
Coughing and Sneezing
Handwashing: Clean Hands Save Lives

Perform regular cleaning of the workplace. Make it a routine to clean all surfaces that people often touch. Examples are workstations, countertops and doorknobs. Use cleaning agents usually used in these areas and follow the directions on the label.
Know how to respond to employees after exposure or who are sick.
Employees who are well but who have a sick family member at home with COVID-19 should:
Tell their supervisor.
Refer to CDC guidance for how to conduct a risk assessment of their
potential exposure.
Contact their local public health department.


If an employee develops COVID-19 infection, employers should:
Work with public health to determine which co-workers had close,
prolonged contact with the ill employee that might put them at risk of exposure to COVID-19. 
Maintain confidenti​ality as required by the Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA).
Employees who have exposure to a co-worker with confirmed COVID-19 should:
Refer to CDC guidance for how to conduct
a risk assessment.
Contact
their local public health department.
Review your outbreak response plans and make sure they are up to date. If you do not have a plan, now is the time to develop one. All outbreaks are reportable. That includes those in the workplace. Contact your local public health department​ if you believe you have an outbreak. They will be able to guide you through how to respond.

your children safe. Lock up guns and
medications even if you trust your child or teen and feel they are safe. It only takes a moment for someone to hurt
themselves in a temporary moment of despair or anger. 
For those who
experience or are at risk of experiencing suicidal thoughts:

​Restrict access
to lethal means in your household - it has been proven to save lives!
​Keep
over-the-counter and prescription medications in a medication lockbox or locked
cabinet.
Ensure firearms
are kept in a gun safe with a trigger lock and store ammunition separately.
Alcohol and other
mind-altering substances can impair judgement and lower inhibitions.
​Consider removing
these from the home or keeping them in a locked cabinet.
Sharps such as
knives, razor blades, and scissors are frequently used to engage in
self-injurious behaviors.
Limit access to
these items when youth are unsupervised.
Develop a safety
plan with your child, such as this one: Patient
Safety Plan Template.
Discuss warning
signs, coping strategies, and healthy activities that can distract your child
from thoughts of self-harm when they do occur.
Have a list of
names and contact information that your child can reach out to for distraction
or help when needed.
Entirely removing
access to technology as a consequence can be very isolating for your child.
​Cutting off a
lifeline to a teen’s friends can result in an emotional backlash and disruption
in the parent-child relationship.
When a lapse in
judgement is related to phone use, ask your child about the behavior and
consider limited privileges targeted to the problematic behavior.
Aim to teach your
children to manage their own relationship with technology.

"In a public health emergency, the role of OSPHL is to begin laboratory testing before commercial labs can test and perform laboratory testing for prioritized populations. As a lower-volume laboratory, OSPHL bridges the gap between emergence of new infections, such as COVID-19, and availability of testing through commercial laboratories. OSPHL also supports testing for vulnerable populations. As more commercial laboratories begin testing, OSPHL may begin to support public health by conducting testing for surveillance purposes rather than direct patient care.
Commercial laboratories now offer expanded capacity for clinicians to order COVID-19 testing at their discretion. Local health systems have started to offer testing in their laboratories, further expanding testing capacity. Collecting samples for commercial lab testing can be done in the outpatient setting if clinically indicated. This testing is based on clinical judgment. It does not require public health approval. Clinic administrators may need to contact commercial labs to set up testing protocols for their clinics.​

Clinicians may order commercial tests in their office based on their clinical judgment; they do not need to contact Public Health. Public Health does not need to give approval to clinicians. The clinician will get the results to give to the patient. Oregon Health Authority and local public health agencies will also receive those results to help in investigations about COVID-19.


Testing at the Oregon State Public Health Laboratory (OSPHL) requires that patients meet certain criteria. Clinicians must notify Public Health that the patient meets criteria and that they intend to send the specimen to OSPHL by completing an online form.

Healthcare providers may decide to have you first tested for other illnesses, like the flu, based on your possible exposure history and any other symptoms you might have. 
Individuals who feel very ill should seek appropriate care. 
If it is an emergency, call 911. If it is not an emergency but you feel sick
enough to need a medical appointment, call your doctor’s office. If you don’t
have a doctor, call 211 for a list of clinics near you. If necessary, visit
your local urgent care center.
Call before you go. If you have flu-like symptoms or have reason to think you might have COVID-19, let your healthcare provider know before you visit. This will help avoid exposing anyone else at the provider’s facility."

test for COVID-19; 
There
are more types of testing available for COVID-19.
Oregon’s testing priorities are as follows:
Test
every Oregonian who is symptomatic even if the symptom is mild. 
Test
asymptomatic individuals in group living situations where COVID-19 is suspected
such as nursing homes, adult foster homes, group homes, farmworker housing,
fishing boats, prisons, and more. 
Conduct
widespread, voluntary sample testing, particularly for at-risk populations. 
Active
and timely contact tracing.
Centralize operations and coordination of testing.

"Homemade masks are not considered PPE, since their capability to protect against COVID-19 is unknown.
Homemade masks are not known to be effective in protecting the wearer against infection. Therefore, OHA does NOT recommend that healthcare personnel wear these masks when taking care of sick patients.
Never put a mask or face covering on an infant or an adult that is not able to adjust or remove the mask themselves. This could compromise their ability to breath.
The use of cloth face coverings may reduce the spread of virus and help prevent those who have the virus but do not have symptoms from passing it to others. Still, the most effective means of preventing the spread of COVID-19 is staying home and avoiding all
non-essential contact with others.
If you are sick:
You should wear a facemask when you are around other people and before you enter a healthcare provider’s office.

The 3/31 Oregon Medicaid waiver includes the following:
OHP
members will not lose or have a reduction in benefits during the COVID-19
crisis. There are a few exceptions to this rule and those are: 
Moving
out of state for a reason not related to COVID-19 
Request by member to close benefits 
Incarceration 
Deceased 
Aged out
Current OHP members will not lose coverage during this
crisis. This includes Cover all Kids coverage that is a state-funded only
benefit, unless they turned 19 years old and aged out of the program and will
be enrolled in CAWEM. 
You can apply for OHP without having to verify income
(submit a pay stub) with your application. You can self-attest, which will help
you get access to OHP coverage more quickly. 
Sign up at ONE.Oregon.gov​ – you may be eligible for OHP even if you have been denied in the past. 
Federal stimulus payments and increased unemployment
payments will not affect OHP eligibility. They will not be counted during the
application process or when members report a change in their household income. 
If you don’t want to apply for OHP, we encourage you
to see a clinician through your county health clinic or through a federally qualified health clinic (FQHC)."

"Serologic testing measures antibodies in the blood of a person who has been infected with COVID-19, whether they felt sick or not. In other words, it measures the bodyâs immune response to the virus, but does not detect the virus itself. According to the FDA, in the early days of an infection when the bodyâs immune response is still building, antibodies may not be detected. This limits the testâs effectiveness for diagnosing COVID-19 and why it should not be used as the sole basis to diagnose COVID-19.
With any test, there is always a risk of incorrect test results â false positive and false negative results. We need a good and accurate test we can rely on. The Vermont Department of Health convened a working group of experts to research antibody tests. Their findings conclude that at this time, the serologic (antibody) tests that are currently available are not accurate or reliable enough. Based on these findings, they caution against using serologic testing to make decisions about individuals. For example, using this test to establish âproof of immunity.â However, this type of test could help us better understand the population-level rate of infection from COVID-19 in Vermont.
We will continue to use public health best practice â considering clinical data, exposure history, and what is happening at the community-level â to make decisions on when to reopen businesses and when to return to work. The working group will continue to meet regularly and will be watching closely for changes and improvements in serologic testing. Recommendations may change based on new data."

"Contact tracing is a strategy used to determine the source of an infection and how it is spreading. Finding people who are close contacts to a person who has tested positive for COVID-19, and therefore at higher risk of becoming infected themselves, can help prevent further spread of the virus.
A team of callers tries to reach anyone who has tested positive for COVID-19. They ask the patient questions about their activities within a certain timeframe â to help identify anyone they had close contact with. (Close contact means being closer than six feet apart for a long time while the person was infectious.) Those contacts might include family members, co-workers or health care providers. Please note, the Health Department only uses a live person for contact tracing and never uses anything that sounds like a âroboâ (computer-generated voice) call.
The team then gets in touch with those contacts and provides health guidance on what to do if you are a close contact of someone who is diagnosed with COVID-19. A close contact is asked to stay home for 14 days and watch for symptoms.
While we have been successful in contact tracing, we will continue to add resources and personnel needed to address any increase in the number of people who test positive, which we expect to happen with more testing. This includes the use of technology to help in these efforts. We will be using an app called SARA Alert, a secure monitoring and reporting system for public health that is being used in other states. This system will allow us to offer people who have tested positive for COVID-19, and their close contacts, to enroll in a text-based system to help us keep in touch and monitor their symptoms.
As the state reopens, Vermonters should consider keeping a contact journal â a list of other people who you have been in close contact with each day. If you do get sick, this would make it easier to get in touch with those people and so they can take proper precautions to prevent further spread of COVID-19."

We complete an in-depth assessment by phone and provide guidance about personal protective equipment and other infection prevention and control recommendations. We continue to stay in touch for any technical assistance needs and additional questions.
If a case of COVID-19 is associated with a long-term care facility, an epidemiology team is quickly activated. They contact the facility to provide recommendations and infection control support. The team begins contact tracing to determine the source of the infection and how it may be spreading. They ask questions and collect information to help identify anyone the patient had close contact with. (Close contact means being closer than 6 feet apart for a long time while the person was infectious.) The team communicates with close contacts to ensure isolation and quarantine guidelines are being followed, which will differ depending on the type of setting."

"As the state continues to reopen, it is more important than ever to make wearing cloth face masks or coverings a habit and to bring one with you whenever you leave home. Cloth face masks or coverings need to be worn in public settings when a physical distance of at least 6 feet is difficult to maintain. For example, visiting a grocery store or on a crowded sidewalk or bike path.
As part of Governor Scottâs Work Smart & Stay Safe - Restart VT: Phase 3, people are required to wear cloth face masks or coverings over their nose and mouth when using public transportationâincluding buses, trains and ride services, and in mass transportation stations or terminals, including airports. Additionally, businesses and non-profit and government organizations may require customers or clients to wear cloth face masks or coverings.
The advice to wear cloth face masks or coverings is based on data about how COVID-19 can spread before a person has any symptoms. Because people may have COVID-19 but no symptoms, wearing cloth face masks or coverings may help keep people from spreading the virus.
We all still need to stay at least 6 feet away from people, even when wearing cloth face masks or coverings, practice good hand hygiene and follow the stateâs Stay Home, Stay Safe guidance.
The cloth face mask or covering must be worn properly to be effective and avoid the spread of germs:


Wash your hands before putting it on.


Be sure your mouth and nose are covered.


Hook loops around your ears or tie it snugly.


Do not touch it or pull it down while in public.


Keep it on until you get home.


Remove it without touching your eyes, nose or mouth, then wash your hands immediately.


Wash it and make sure itâs completely dry before using again. Have a few on hand so you can rotate for washing.


Some people should never wear a cloth face mask or covering, including:


Children under the age of 2


Anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious


Anyone who is unable to remove it without assistance


Medical-grade mask supplies are needed for our health care workers and first responders. Please use cloth face masks or coverings for your yourself and loved ones.
If you feel sick, stay home to rest and avoid going out into public places. If you are sick and plan to see a doctor, you should call the office before your visit. Your doctor can provide guidance on how to avoid spreading illness, such as what steps to take while traveling to their facility and upon arrival.

"Close contact means being within 6 feet, for a long time, of someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 during their infectious period, which starts two days (48 hours) before any symptoms began and continues until they are recovered. Close contact does not mean being more than 6 feet away in the same indoor environment for a long period of time, walking by, or briefly being in the same room with someone.
A âlong period of timeâ is hard to define because it depends on whether the person was sick at the time and what type of interaction you had with that person. These examples can help you determine whether you were a close contact or not.
Examples of close contacts:


You live in the same home.


You are intimate partners.


You rode in the same car while the person was infectious.


You had dinner together while the person was infectious.


Examples of not close contacts:


You were their cashier at the grocery store.


You are a pharmacist who gave the person medication.


You were in front of the person in line at the store.


You are a coworker who briefly walked by to ask a question.


A team at the Health Department works with people with COVID-19 to identify their close contacts. This is called contact tracing. The team assesses each close contact for their exposure risk and gives them health guidance and recommendations for self-isolation or other restrictions.
As the state reopens, Vermonters should consider keeping a contact journal â a list of other people who you have been in close contact with
each day. If you do get sick, this would make it easier to get in touch
with those people and so they can take proper precautions to prevent further spread of COVID-19.
The chart describing what is isolation, quarantine and self-observation has details about what you should do and not do, depending on your exposure risk.

"Yes, people can continue to use reusable grocery bags. However, some stores are choosing to no longer allow reusable bags and containers at this time. Check with your local store for their current policies.
Current evidence suggests that the COVID-19 virus may live for hours to days on surfaces made from a variety of materials. It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
It is important to remember to wash your hands before you eat and avoid touching your face. Washing or wiping down your reusable bags with a disinfectant continues to be a best practice for preventing bacterial illnesses, such as E.coli, from meat and unwashed fruits and vegetables."

"Plan ways to care for those in your home who might be at greater risk for serious complications, like older adults (65 years and older) and people of any age who have underlying medical conditions. Make sure those who need regular medicine, medical supplies and equipment have what they need.


Choose a room in your home that can be used to separate sick household members from those who are healthy. Identify a separate bathroom for the sick person to use, if possible. Plan to clean these rooms, as needed, when someone is sick.


Make sure you have enough groceries and other supplies for 14 days in case you get sick and need to quarantine. Stock up on only what you will need for 14 days. Do not buy more than you will need so you can leave supplies for other people.


Get support from others. Talk with your neighbors about emergency planning. If your neighborhood has Front Porch Forum, consider joining to connect with neighbors, information and resources. Stay in touch by phone or email with family and friends, especially those who are 65 years and older, who have underlying medical conditions, or who live alone.


Take care of the emotional health of your household members. Outbreaks can be stressful for adults and children. Talk with your children about the outbreak, try to stay calm, and reassure them that they are safe.


Keep a daily list of other people you are in close contact with. As the state reopens, Vermonters should consider keeping a contact journal.

"COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning about how it makes people sick.
Cause
COVID-19: Caused by one virus, the novel 2019 coronavirus, now called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2.
Flu: Caused by any of several different types and strains of influenza viruses.
Transmission
While both the flu and COVID-19 may be transmitted in similar ways, there is also a possible difference: COVID-19 might be spread through the airborne route, meaning that tiny droplets remaining in the air could cause disease in others even after the ill person is no longer near.
Antiviral Medications
COVID-19: Antiviral medications are currently being tested to see if they can address symptoms.
Flu: Antiviral medications can address symptoms and sometimes shorten the duration of the illness.
Vaccine
COVID-19: No vaccine is available at this time, though it is in progress.
Flu: A vaccine is available and effective to prevent some of the most dangerous types or to reduce the severity of the flu.

"If you are having symptoms of COVID-19, call your health care provider to find out if you should be tested.
Follow these guidelines to help keep others from getting sick:
Isolate at home:


Donât leave home, except to get medical care. Call ahead before visiting a health care provider or emergency department. Wear a cloth face mask or covering if you need to leave home for medical care


Most people with mild illness can recover at home. While there is no specific treatment for COVID-19, you should get plenty of rest, drink plenty of fluids, and take fever-reducing medication if needed.


Stay in a specific room in your home and use a separate bathroom, as much as possible. Stay at least 6 feet away from others in your home at all times and wear a cloth face mask or covering if you are in the same room with them. Donât share household items.


Have someone else care for your pets. There have been a small number of pets, including cats and dogs, reported to be infected with the COVID-19 virus, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19. If you must care for your pet, wear a cloth face mask or covering, and wash your hands before and after.


Daily cleaning and washing:


Clean and disinfect surfaces in your separate room and bathroom. Have someone else clean the other areas of your home.


Thoroughly wash household items, like utensils, after using.


Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol if soap and water arenât available.

"Social distancing means maintaining a physical distance (approximately 6 feet or 2 meters) from others you do not live with. This includes when you're inside a store or outside for exercise.
The COVID-19 virus spreads easily from person-to-person. It travels through the air when a sick person coughs, sneezes or talks. One way to contain the spread of COVID-19 is to stop people from sharing it. Without a vaccine or treatment, we can help contain the virus by:


Staying at home to protect others if you are sick.


Staying home is still the best way to lower our risk of COVID-19, but small groups of 10 or fewer people are now allowed if health and safety precautions are followed. Learn how to safely connect with friends and family.


Continuing to go outside, take walks, do essential errands while maintaining a physical distance from others and practicing proper hygiene. Remember that ticks are active this time of year. Find out how to Be Tick Smart and prevent tick bites.


Wearing a cloth face mask or covering in public settings when a physical distance of at least 6 feet is difficult to maintain, especially at the grocery store, pharmacy, doctorâs office, hospital or other essential business or office, and on a crowded sidewalk or bike path.


Washing your hands (adults and children) any time you go inside, before you eat, and before you spend time with people who are more vulnerable to the effects of COVID-19."

Can I continue to socialize?	"Whatever your age, staying home is still the best way to lower our risk of COVID-19, but many of us are eager to take small steps to safely see our friends and family again. Small groups of 10 or fewer people are now allowed if health and safety precautions are followed. Learn how to safely connect with friends and family.
While older adults (65 years and older) and people of any age with underlying medical conditions are at greatest risk, young people are not immune to getting sick. Even people who show only mild symptoms may pass the virus to others â particularly in the early course of the infection, before they even realize they are sick. Taking health and safety precautions protects everyone and helps slow the spread of this virus."

"Making sure neighbors have what they need is crucial, but we need to make sure helpers and volunteers are still taking precautions to protect our most vulnerable Vermonters. Common sense practices can go a long way while Vermonters take care of each other.
The Vermont Department of Health recommends any volunteers bringing items to those who need to stay home:


Keep a distance of 6 feet away.


Avoid entering the personâs home.


Wear a cloth face mask or covering.


Wash your hands regularly.


Avoid touching your face and cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.


Stop doing community support work immediately if you feel sick or find out you have had contact with someone who is sick.


Keep a list of anyone you come into close contact with in case contact tracing is required.


Wear clean gloves when handling items that may be given to people with a weaker immune system, and when you are close to someone who may be sick."

This includes separating patients with COVID-19 from other patients. There is a greater risk to staying at home if you're experiencing symptoms of a serious medical condition than going to the hospital.
As of May 4, health care providers may also begin to do some clinic visits, diagnostic imaging, and outpatient surgeries and procedures again â as long as they have a minimal impact on inpatient hospital bed capacity and personal protective equipment (PPE).

Take breaks from watching, reading, or listening to news stories, including social media. Hearing about the pandemic repeatedly can be upsetting.


Take care of your body. Take deep breaths, stretch, or meditate. Try to eat healthy, well-balanced meals, exercise regularly, get plenty of sleep, and avoid alcohol and drugs.


Make time to unwind. Try to do some other activities you enjoy.


Connect with others. Talk with people you trust about your concerns and how you are feeling.

"As reports appear in the news of certain drugs being potentially used for treatment or prevention of COVID-19, the Vermont Department of Health strongly urges caution.
Though the anti-malarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, among others, have been widely discussed as potential treatments, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said there are no data currently available from randomized clinical trials that would inform how these drugs could be used to treat COVID-19.
In fact, there are significant potential risks to taking such drugs, including death.
Health officials remind Vermonters that most people who get COVID-19 can manage their symptoms at home with rest, drinking fluids and taking fever-reducing medication. Talk to your health care provider before taking any substance alleged to prevent or treat COVID-19.
Providers should only prescribe these drugs for individuals with diagnosed conditions, and not for prevention, to help maintain the supply for Vermonters who need them."

Be cautious and choose low-risk activities to avoid injury. This will help lower the burden on our hospitals and health care system.


Respect signs for closed areas, trails and land. Check Trail Finder to find out if your trail is currently open before you visit. Call ahead or check websites for information on outdoor recreation facilities before you head out.


Choose no-contact sports: For example, biking, hiking, horseback riding, tennis, boating and golfing. Outdoor basketball courts may be open to shoot hoops, but signage should be posted prohibiting contact games. Do not share sports equipment with people outside of your household.

When will the Stay Home, Stay Safe Order end?	"Most recent modeling data suggests Vermont has reached its peak in the number of new cases of COVID-19, hospital capacity, and the number people who are currently infected with COVID-19.
However, it is important to remember there are still many people who are currently infected and therefore, are contagious and could spread it to others.
Vermont is looking at four key measures to inform steps to reopen:


Ongoing reduction in cases for at least 14 days


A health care system that is safely able to treat all patients without exceeding its capacity or using crisis standards of care


The ability to test all people with symptoms


Widespread active monitoring of people who have tested positive for COVID-19 and tracing their close contacts


At this time, Vermont has seen a reduction in cases for at least 14 days. This is hopeful news. To continue on this path, it is critical that Vermonters continue making their day-to-day sacrifices to help save lives. Social distancing (staying at least 6 feet from each other) and wearing cloth face masks or coverings are here to stay for a while, even as we being to reopen, until we have effective antiviral medicines or a vaccine.

Infection with SARS-CoV-2 is associated with respiratory tissue damage that can impair lung function and even cause death. Though it is likely that both the virus and immune system contribute to this process, it can be difficult to determine which mechanism causes the most damage. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 is associated with respiratory tissue damage that can impair lung function and even cause death. Though it is likely that both the virus and immune system contribute to this process, it can be difficult to determine which mechanism causes the most damage. To establish infection, a virus must enter a host cell. Once inside, it hijacks the cell’s machinery to replicate, eventually killing the cell and releasing more virus. This process not only damages host tissues, but also potently activates the immune system. The immune system in turn unleashes powerful weapons to control the infection. However, if not carefully regulated, the immune response itself can cause collateral damage to host tissues and exacerbate disease severity. More research on the host and viral factors that contribute to severe COVID-19 disease and death could provide important clues for clinicians and researchers in the search for new treatments.

By well maintained, we mean that the system is inspected periodically, the filters are changed according to manufacturer recommendations, the duct systems are cleaned periodically, and the most efficient filters available are used (for example, MERV [minimum efficiency reporting  value] filters with a rating of 13 to 16 for homes; HEPA [high-efficiency particulate air] filters for hospitals). Keep in mind, that even in well-ventilated environments, people should continue following recommendations of physical distancing, face covering, and frequent hand hygiene. At present, there is no strong evidence to suggest that a well-maintained air conditioning, ventilation, or other type of climate control system will contribute to the transmission of COVID-19.

That’s true with influenza: Even if a certain strain disappears, a new one might emerge from animals—as we’ve seen with avian viruses. But with a major outbreak like COVID-19 already underway in humans, the big question is how good humans are at developing immunity. And, if they gain immunity, does it stick, or does it fizzle out over time—leaving the door open a crack for the virus to return? As the first cases get further and further out from the point of infection, that data will give us a better idea of what to expect.

Cash can be contaminated with potential bacterial pathogens, but there is little information about viruses on cash in general—and nothing about contamination with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Cash can be contaminated with potential bacterial pathogens, but there is little information about viruses on cash in general—and nothing about contamination with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 is spread by person-to-person contact—not normally by touching fomites (objects that may be contaminated with, and help transmit, infectious organisms) like cash. And, it’s unclear how long COVID-19 remains viable on surfaces—ranging from a few minutes to hours to potentially days depending on the temperature, humidity and surface type. Switching from cash to plastic has not been proven more protective, either, except perhaps by reducing person-to person hand exposure. Some countries are washing or disinfecting cash, but there is no data demonstrating how this process works. The best practice is social distancing: limiting person-to-person contact by shutting down schools, bars, and other crowded places. That is what will slow infections, prevent health care systems from overloading, and reduce deaths. That is why everyone should do their part and embrace social distancing rather than worrying about using money or credit cards.

Cryptic transmission is the term that is used when there is no direct contact between person 1 shedding the virus and person 2 contracting it. Cryptic transmission is the term that is used when there is no direct contact between person 1 shedding the virus and person 2 contracting it. It is an important indicator of community prevalence of a virus. There is essentially enough circulating virus in a community to transmit the same strain of the virus between individuals who are not directly linked. In the case of the COVID-19 outbreak, this term came into the lexicon after University of Washington researchers sequenced the COVID-19 genome from Snohomish County, Washington, which showed a direct genetic link from the first 2 cases in Washington though they had no known contact. This indicated there was significant community spread, and likely evidence the virus had been circulating for weeks by that point. As I noted on Twitter, the key takeaway is this is going to be a critical path for viral transmission given the potential infectivity prior to the manifestation of symptoms—and what will ultimately make it so hard to control the spread of the virus.

"The symptoms of COVID-19—including fever, cough, and difficulty breathing—are similar to those of other cold and flu viruses. At this moment, the decision to test for COVID-19 in the US depends on both the patient’s clinical status and what is happening in a particular geographic location. A history of travel, especially international travel to one of the most affected areas, is still important, but this is evolving as the outbreak develops domestically. Close contact with someone who traveled to those areas or with someone who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 are other considerations.
The evaluation of cold and flu symptoms will often include testing for routine respiratory viruses as well, especially influenza. In general, if you do not have symptoms and would not ordinarily seek medical care based on how you feel now, you do not need evaluation or testing for COVID-19."

"Infection rate and progression to severe disease in pregnant women is similar to that in nonpregnant adult women. The same protective measures against transmission of the virus apply to both.
 
So far, no transmission from mother to fetus has been described. Vaginal delivery should be encouraged when both the mother and the baby are not severely sick. Strict protective measures (facemasks, hand hygiene) must be observed to protect the newborn and the personnel during and after childbirth.
 
Separation of the mother and baby and breastfeeding should be discussed on a case-by-case basis with the mother. The newborn should be protected from infection by the mother as much as possible. If the mother wishes to express her milk or breastfeed, disinfection of the breast should be added to the protection methods mentioned above."

Unless I see data otherwise, I’d assume that most of us are immunologically “naive.” However, although we don’t know if it’s relevant to COVID-19 epidemiology, it has been shown that antibodies against SARS-CoV can block infection of cells with SARS-CoV-2 , so there is the possibility of protective cross-reactive immunity from closely related coronaviruses.

In the case of n-coronavirus, the vaccine challenges are 2-fold. First, you have to interfere with the virus’s ability to dock with a specific receptor in the lungs called ACE2. Then, you need to reduce the problem of antibody-dependent enhancement. ADE means that some respiratory virus vaccines can actually make things worse. There are multiple ways to solve this problem. One option is creating a vaccine that only uses parts of the pathogen to stimulate the immune system. One approach is to do this by producing recombinant protein subunit vaccines. We have found that these vaccines that use a part of a protein of the virus (the spike protein) and known as the receptor binding domain (RBD) are optimal for 2 reasons: Recombinant proteins are a standard technology that has resulted in other licensed vaccines, including the hepatitis B and HPV vaccines; and it’s possible to produce this vaccine in abundance and at low cost.

Reinfection is also possible within the window after the first infection and before you develop antibodies. That window can vary from a couple of weeks to a few months, depending on how much your immune system was triggered. We’ve now got a good population of people who have recovered from the virus. Serum samples from those patients can allow us to time exactly when they begin to develop antibodies and when they develop sufficient titers and neutralizing antibodies.

Mortality rates will vary by country according to several factors. First, it will depend on the age structure of the population; Italy has the second oldest population in the world, which  may partly explain the high mortality observed. Health care availability (in terms of the number of hospital and intensive care beds) and accessibility (free versus paid) will also influence mortality. For example, low death rates in Germany and South Korea are partially attributed to the relatively high number of hospital beds per capita. Moreover, disparities in death rates between Hubei province—the location of Wuhan, where the outbreak first emerged—and other parts of China are thought to be due to the rapid case rise and resulting strain on health care resources in Hubei. Lastly, a country’s testing policy will be an important determining factor. If there is widespread testing of community as well as hospital-based cases, mortality will be lower than if testing was solely focused on hospital cases.

But clearly not all people become sick even in the worst pandemics. Epidemiologists typically mean an infectious disease epidemic that has spread or is spreading globally. Usually we refer to a pandemic only when it involves a new disease. So, for example, we talk about an influenza pandemic when there is a new strain of flu spreading around the world. In contrast, we do not refer to the global outbreak of seasonal influenza as a pandemic because the strains are not new. There is no strict definition of when an epidemic becomes a pandemic—but usually it means that the disease is actively spreading on several continents with likely continued spread to other continents.

"About 60% of newly emerged and re-emerging pathogens share a common origin: the bodies of animals. Genetic and epidemiological evidence suggest that the novel coronavirus, like SARS, may have emerged from a so-called “wet market,” where wild species that would rarely encounter each other in nature are crammed together, allowing microbes to spread between species and into humans. China claimed to have cracked down on these markets after the SARS outbreak, but when I visited a few years later, it wasn’t hard to find one. 
But such markets are only part of the problem. The loss of wildlife habitat around the world more generally is forcing wild species to cram into closer proximity to human settlements. Bats, for example, have been fingered as the source of Ebola, SARS, and a host of other pathogens. When we cut down the forests where they live, they come roost in our backyards and farms instead. It’s this kind of novel, intimate contact that provides opportunities for the microbes that live in their bodies to spread into ours.

Maybe a person is at the right time of infection and at the mall. Typhoid Mary infected many people because she was a cook. Part of the reason we stopped SARS is that a lot of super spreading was happening in health care settings and when people really got their act together in terms of infection control and biocontainment, it nipped the epidemic in the bud. Super spreading events have the largest influence an outbreak’s trajectory early on. If there’s only a few cases and one person then infects 10 others, it can make it start strong. Once an epidemic gets going and has 100 to 200 cases or more, the “law of large numbers” takes over—and it stops mattering so much.

We’ll eventually have a vaccine, but that may be in 18 months or 5 years from now.
 
I think there will be waves of the epidemic across the US. What’s happening now in Seattle and New York, and to a lesser extent in San Francisco, will happen in Baltimore and Dallas at different times. Each wave will last a couple of months—from valley to peak to valley. As we begin to relax social distancing efforts—which we will have to do because society can’t stay like this—the disease will start to come back.

Data transparency and political sensitivity are two of the most critical challenges to effective global cooperation on the COVID-19 outbreak—and they are deeply entwined. Data transparency and political sensitivity are two of the most critical challenges to effective global cooperation on the COVID-19 outbreak—and they are deeply entwined. China has a history of concealing, delaying or refusing to share data and information (this happened with SARS in 2002-2003 and in 2018, when China reportedly refused to share samples of a bird flu with pandemic potential). Leading global health agencies have praised China’s response to COVID-19, while other experts doubt the accuracy of the reported data. Data transparency is key to building much-needed trust—and preventing the misallocation of resources, which could slow the response. Some countries in Asia—where China holds significant economic and political influence—have carefully crafted their public coronavirus responses, aware that criticizing China could hinder cooperation. And all stakeholders face a difficult task: balancing effective disease response with the political sensitivity necessary for a successful, cooperative, global response.

The development of vaccines and drugs for COVID-19 share common goals: to ensure safety and efficacy. These are often assessed through a series of studies, sometimes beginning with animal experiments, progressing through human phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical trials with increasing numbers of participants. However, it often takes much longer to develop and rigorously assess a vaccine. First, vaccines are usually targeted to healthy people, in contrast to drugs administered to people with disease. Larger and longer studies are often needed to ensure the safety of vaccines. Second, the outcomes of interest often take much longer to be measured. Vaccine efficacy and immunogenicity can take many months to measure accurately, whereas whether or not a treated patient improves can take days. And some vaccines require multiple doses spread out over months whereas drug treatment regimens typically are days to weeks. Once developed, it can also take longer to manufacture and deploy vaccines.

Public health departments would use that money to ensure expertise in emergency and pandemic planning. That’s key not only for the public health preparedness, but for preparedness in hospitals and long-term care facilities as well. The money could also be used for supplies.

1.  Control their symptoms: Give them medications that make having COVID-19 more tolerable—ones that control fever, cough, and other commonly associated symptoms.
2.  Provide intensive support to the body of a sick person as their immune system battles the infection: We see that some patients may become critically ill with this disease, hence they may need mechanical ventilation or urgent dialysis. There may be a role for technologies such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation to help their lungs recover from acute respiratory distress syndrome.
3.  Treat other infections that COVID-19 patients may get, such as concurrent bacterial pneumonia because their lungs are not functioning as well as they can. In this case, clinicians will use antibiotics to help them recover."

The CDC believes it is likely that COVID-19 will cause a pandemic, but there are steps that the public can take to protect and prepare themselves. First, it is important to stay informed and follow instructions issued by your local or state health department and the CDC. Basic infection control measures still apply in this scenario. Practicing good handwashing techniques or using hand sanitizer, avoiding people who are ill, and staying home when you are sick are all effective measures. A pandemic could interrupt supply chains and result in closures at local businesses, meaning it may be prudent to stock reserves of critical supplies. Examples include extra prescription medications, asthma relief inhalers, over-the-counter anti-fever and pain medications, non-perishable food items, household cleaning supplies, and toiletries.

Or the person living with HIV, TB, or some other chronic condition who can no longer receive lifesaving medications, either because of a breakdown or diversion of the pipeline intended to provide those. Furthermore, these very populations are at greater risk of poor outcomes from a disease like COVID-19, creating a potentially vicious cycle. That is why it's essential that policymakers and practitioners shore up resources that protect progress in other critical areas of global health, while preventing fallout from a new public health enemy.

Today’s communication environment is a sea of rapidly changing “information,” confusion and distrust. Events shift rapidly, and conflicting perspectives, opinions and statements and accusations of “fake news” are common. Science-based information, when inconvenient, can be contested as just another perspective while repetition is used to establish “facts.” In this environment, presenting public health information so it is trusted, understood and acted upon is difficult but possible.

The reproductive number represents the average number of people that one infected person will infect.

The reproductive number represents the average number of people that one infected person will infect. The reproductive number for a disease can change based on how infectious the pathogen is, the host population, and environmental factors. To control an outbreak, the goal is to reduce a disease’s reproductive number to less than 1. If the reproductive number remains 1 or higher, the outbreak will continue. In the case of COVID-19, the estimated reproductive number is around 2.6, meaning the outbreak is expected to continue. The reproductive number can be reduced by altering transmission dynamics—with social distancing, home isolation, quarantine, and use of personal protective equipment in health care settings. Over time as people are infected and recover—or if a vaccine becomes available (which may take months or years)—immunity in the population also reduces the effective reproductive number of a disease.

Travel bans can’t keep all cases of the virus out of a country. As the epidemic expands, cases may originate in any number of countries. We may already have unrecognized cases in the US. Travel bans can actually make us less safe. They can make countries facing restrictions not want to share information about their outbreaks. They can disrupt the distribution of supplies needed to control the epidemic. Similarly, as we saw with the US’s Ebola response in 2014, quarantining returning travelers makes doctors and nurses less likely to volunteer to serve in affected countries. This virus is likely past the point of containment. We need to focus on mitigating its impact by speeding the development of diagnostic tools, vaccines, and drugs to treat infections.

Strong health systems are certainly a crucial foundation for preparedness. All countries, rich or poor, need to have a set of core national preparedness capabilities. For example, they need strong surveillance systems in place that can detect infectious diseases with pandemic potential, robust case detection, and effective contact tracing (i.e., identifying and reaching those who may have been in contact with an infected person).

But that’s only part of the story. By definition, pandemics cross national boundaries—they are global in nature and they require a global response, not just a national one. A whole set of “transnational” activities, called global public goods, is another critical plank in pandemic preparedness. These require collective funding by countries. Such goods include developing medical countermeasures like pandemic vaccines, diagnostics, and treatments, stockpiling of medical supplies (including personal protective equipment), and ensuring that there is global “surge capacity” to rapidly scale up production and distribution of vaccines.

This keeps them safe from infection in “peace time” and during a large outbreak like we have now. Health care workers are often the first affected by these types of outbreaks and to some extent can act as a canary in the coalmine for how infectious a new disease outbreak is.  In the past, health care workers have died from infections and also amplified initial cases spreading the outbreak quickly.  If we are to protect health workers and limit transmission, we must do more to ensure the right training and the right equipment are available all the time and not just once an outbreak has started. Health workers are making heroic efforts in China, where they have converged on the epicenter. They can only protect us if they are protected.

The tools of public health during suspected infectious outbreaks include limits or restrictions on the movement of individual citizens, ranging from travel bans, to closure of businesses and schools, to isolation of individuals in their homes, to forced quarantine in medical facilities. The goal in implementing public health measures during suspected outbreaks is to balance the freedom of individuals against the restrictions on freedom required to achieve legitimate protections of the public's health, with public and transparent justification of policy decisions. Whatever restrictions are implemented should be the least restrictive to accomplish the stated public health goals. Quarantine is considered a measure of last resort given the severe restrictions it imposes on individual liberty, and when misused or ineffective can severely undermine trust in government.

Will it change to become more lethal or more easily transmitted?”	The SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 will likely continue with minimal variation. It will probably stay stable because very few people are immune—so many “naïve” human hosts are still available for maintaining current transmission cycles. The SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 will likely continue with minimal variation. It will probably stay stable because very few people are immune—so many “naïve” human hosts are still available for maintaining current transmission cycles. This virus appears very balanced in terms of transmission-to-virulence. It also can be transmitted early in infection. Serious disease usually doesn’t occur until much later—and by that time, many patients are confined to a hospital bed. Consequently, a long transmission window is present before a person falls seriously ill, giving the virus plenty of time to spread. Selection is heavily driven by transmissibility, and the role of virulence in this process is much less clear.

"The likelihood of getting infected with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) through export goods originating from China or elsewhere is quite low. Although SARS-CoV-2 can survive on surfaces from 2 hours to 9 days, it is vulnerable to heat, changes in pH, and common disinfectants.  Since SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus (meaning it has a fragile outer layer), it is less stable and more susceptible to disinfectants. Therefore, the risk of an infected person contaminating commercial goods is low—and so is the risk of catching the disease from a package that has been transported and exposed to different conditions (and temperatures).
So, feel free to order that dress from China or those leather shoes from Italy. While you are at it, wash your hands and maybe wipe the surface with a disinfectant because informed preventive measures are what we need to stop both COVID-19 and the fear epidemic from spreading."

Could someone get COVID-19 from a blood transfusion?	COVID-19 doesn’t pose any known risk to blood donors during the donation process or from attending blood drives. COVID-19 doesn’t pose any known risk to blood donors during the donation process or from attending blood drives. Blood donation is a highly regulated, safe process—and most centers have implemented additional precautions including increased sanitation of donor areas, use of PPE, and social distancing to enhance their already-healthy environments. Additionally, since donors must be healthy on donation day, risk of exposure to sick individuals is extremely low. While donors may worry that they could be infected but asymptomatic, respiratory viruses are not generally thought to be transmitted by blood transfusion. There are no reported cases to date of transfusion transmission of COVID-19. Even during a shelter-in-place, people still require critical medical care. They will continue to be in car crashes, need emergency organ transplants and chemotherapy, and give birth to babies in critical condition. The need for blood is constant, and we continue to rely on blood donors’ generosity.

When a virus passes from a nonhuman animal into a human, we call that moment of spillover a zoonotic transmission. It’s an ecological event. What happens next depends on evolutionary potential and chance. If the virus is adaptable, it may succeed in replicating and proliferating in the new human host. Maybe it kills the person and the line of transmission comes to an end there—as happens with rabies. But if the virus is even more adaptable, it may acquire the ability to pass from one human host to another, perhaps by sexual contact (as with HIV), perhaps in bodily fluids such as blood (as with Ebola), perhaps in respiratory droplets launched by coughing or sneezing (as with influenza or SARS). What makes a virus adaptable? The changeability of its genome, plus Darwinian natural selection. Those viruses with single-stranded RNA genomes, which replicate themselves inaccurately and therefore have highly changeable genomes, are among the most adaptable. Coronaviruses belong to that group.

Contract tracing is a core public health function that public health agencies have done for years. Diagnostic tests can confirm whether a person is infected with an illness. Contact tracing involves finding out who the infected person had contacts with so that those individuals can be alerted that they are at a risk of developing the illness and at risk of potentially infecting others in the community.During contact tracing, the contacts of the infected person are generally called up, asked if they're feeling sick, and advised to self-quarantine for a period of time. During the quarantine period, the health of the contacts can be monitored and health care or other services could be provided to them if they do develop symptoms. Also, it is important to make sure that people who have been exposed to the illness are not circulating in the community and further spreading the disease.

As of April 19, the only pets incidentally exposed to COVID-19 that have tested positive, with confirmation, for SARS-CoV-2 are two pet dogs and a pet cat in Hong Kong. Another pet cat in Belgium tested positive, but details around that case are less clear.. In each case, the pet was in the care of and had close contact with a person who had been confirmed to have COVID-19. Only in the case of the cat in Belgium was there a suggestion of the animal showing clinical signs of disease and, in that case, other diseases and conditions that could have caused those same signs of illness were not ruled out and there are also questions about how samples demonstrating the presence of SARS-CoV-2 were collected and evaluated. That cat recovered.In a French study, tests (RT-PCR and antibody evaluation via an immunoprecipitation assay) performed on 21 pets (12 dogs and 9 cats) living in close contact with their 20 French veterinary student owners (2 of whom were confirmed to have COVID-19 infection and 11 more of whom showed symptoms consistent with COVID-19) all yielded negative results.Two commercial laboratories in the United States reported they have tested (RT-PCR) thousands of specimens from dogs and cats for SARS-CoV-2 and have obtained no positive results. These specimens have come from the United States, South Korea, Canada, and Europe, including regions concurrently experiencing human COVID-19 cases. While this is encouraging, the specimens tested were originally submitted for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of more common pathogens causing respiratory disease in dogs and cats and, as such, per-case information as to whether or not these dogs and cats had contact with confirmed COVID-19 positive people is not available.As of April 19, the CDC had not received any National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL)-confirmed reports of pets becoming sick with COVID-19 in the United States.Preliminary findings from limited laboratory experimental studies indicate that, of species tested thus far, cats are the species most susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2. Some cats in these studies developed signs of clinical disease. Ferrets were also found to be susceptible to infection, but appeared less likely to develop disease. In the laboratory setting cats and ferrets were also able to transmit SARS-CoV-2 to other cats and ferrets, respectively. Dogs appeared to be susceptible to infection, but less so than cats or ferrets. Other preliminary laboratory findings indicate that poultry and pigs are not susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2. It is important to understand that experimentally induced infection does not mirror naturally induced infection. In other words, just because an animal can be experimentally infected via inoculation with high concentrations of purified tissue-cultured virus does not mean that it will be easily be infected with that same virus under natural conditions. The number of animals involved in these studies was also very small and conclusions were drawn based on data that, in some cases, were collected from as few as two animals.There is no evidence to suggest that animals, including pets, that may be incidentally infected by humans are playing a role in the spread of COVID-19. Human outbreaks are driven by person-to-person transmission.Pets have other types of coronaviruses that can cause them to become ill, but these are species-specific, meaning that they do not infect people and are not related to the current COVID-19 outbreak.We will continue to provide you with information as we learn more about pets and SARS-COV-2. Because animals can spread other diseases to people and people can also spread diseases to animals, it’s a good idea to always wash your hands before and after interacting with and caring for your pets, as well as before and after handling their food, supplies, and waste.

Current clinical management includes the application of infection prevention and control measures, such as separating the patient from other people and pets in the home and aggressive hygiene and disinfection and supportive care, including supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilatory support when indicated. While researchers are studying new drugs and drugs that are already approved for other health conditions as possible treatments for COVID-19 (e.g., Remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, investigational antivirals, immunotherapeutics, host-directed therapies), currently there are no drugs that are specifically FDA-approved for treatment of this disease. The FDA is working with drug manufacturers, researchers, and other partners to accelerate the development and approval process for COVID-19 treatments. Information on registered clinical trials for COVID-19 in the United States is available at ClinicalTrials.gov. Interest has emerged regarding ivermectin as a potential treatment after Australian scientists demonstrated that a single dose eradicated all genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 growing in cell culture within 48 hours. Additional testing in animals and people is required to determine whether these in vitro results are mirrored in vivo and what dose might be effective in treating the virus, while still being safe to administer to people. There has been similar interest around the use of chloroquine phosphate after a publication was released suggesting some efficacy for its use in treating COVID-19-associated pneumonia in clinical studies. While used to treat malaria and certain other conditions in people, chloroquine phosphate is also available in a different formulation to treat disease in aquarium fish and at least one person has died from ingesting chloroquine phosphate in that formulation. Because ivermectin is also readily available in formulations used to treat animals, similar concerns exist around the misuse of this drug and FDA has issued a warning accordingly.While we are all anxious to find a treatment for COVID-19, it is very important that people not self-medicate with prescription medications or over-the-counter drugs that are not prescribed or recommended for them by their doctor for their particular health condition(s) and veterinarians should advise clients accordingly.

Onset and duration of viral shedding and the period of infectiousness for COVID-19 are not yet known. There are reports of asymptomatic infections (detection of virus with no development of corresponding symptoms) and pre-symptomatic infections (detection of virus prior to development of symptoms) with SARS-CoV-2, but their role in transmission is not yet known. Based on existing literature, the incubation period (detection of virus prior to development of symptoms) ranges from two to 14 days.

Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 most often occurs when a person infected with the virus releases droplets by coughing, sneezing, speaking, singing, or exhaling. These droplets are generally too heavy to hang in the air, and quickly fall onto floors or other surfaces. All else being equal, the stronger the exhale (coughing or sneezing as compared with normal exhalation) the more droplets are released and the farther the droplets may be dispersed. Taking this into account, many states have now adopted social distancing of 6 feet because virtually all sizes of droplets disperse short of that radius.Exhaled droplets eventually land somewhere; for example, on hands, shirt sleeves, countertops, and floors. Droplets can also land on or be transferred by touch to other often-touched surfaces, such as door handles, silver and dinnerware, keys, and steering wheels. Coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, have been shown to survive in the environment from a few hours to a few days, depending on the type of surface, temperature, humidity, and contact with ultraviolet light. Touching one’s mouth, nose, or eyes with SARS-CoV-2-contaminated hands after touching contaminated surfaces is a secondary route of exposure. Results of an experimental laboratory study suggest that detectable amounts of SARS-CoV-2 virus remain in the air, and on copper, cardboard, stainless steel, and plastic during favorable conditions for the virus (71 to 73°F) for three, four, 24, 72, and 72 hours, respectively. This study, however, involved a much larger viral load than might be expected after normal exposures so the retention times reported may be a worse-case scenario. Virus was also detected in a hospital room of a COVID-19 patient prior to routine cleaning, but no virus was detected after routine cleaning of that patient’s room.

SARS-CoV-2 is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person, including between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet [2 meters]), through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks. Some recent studies have suggested that COVID-19 may be spread by people who are not showing symptoms of the disease, so maintaining social distance (about 6 feet) is important to preventing the spread of COVID-19. It may be possible to contract COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching your mouth, nose, or possibly your eyes. While this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads, CDC recommends people practice frequent hand hygiene, which is either washing hands with soap or water or using an alcohol-based hand rub. CDC also recommends routine cleaning of frequently touched surfaces.

Was there an intermediate host?	The precise mechanism of evolution of SARS-CoV-2 from bats (if that is where SARS-CoV-2 came from) to people is not presently known. At least two scenarios have been proposed. The first has the virus evolving to its current pathogenicity through natural section in a non-human host (e.g., bat) and jumping to humans. There are no documented cases of bat to human transmission of a coronavirus; previous coronaviruses have passed through an intermediate mammal host before human infection. The identity of the SARS-CoV-2 intermediate host (if there is one) is also currently unknown, but several have been suggested including pangolins and stray dogs. In an alternative scenario, a nonpathogenic version of the virus would have jumped from an animal host to humans and then evolved within humans to its current pathogenic state. These are all hypotheses based on comparative analysis of RNA coronaviral sequences and none have been confirmed to date.

This is a hypothesis. The RNA sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to that of other coronaviruses circulating in bats in Southeast Asia. Taxonomically, SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus. Using molecular clock analysis, betacoronaviruses are reported to have originated about 3,300 BC. Bats are considered to be ideal hosts for alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses.Sars-CoV-2 viruses isolated from different human COVID-19 patients are reported to have almost identical sequences and the sequences are reported to be 88% and 89.1% analogous with bat-SL-CoVZC45, and 96% analogous with BatCoV RaTG13. BatCoV RaTG13 was previously detected in the horseshoe bat, which is found in South and Southeast Asia and southern and central China.

On April 5, the US Department of Agriculture’s National Veterinary Services Laboratories announced a positive finding of SARS-CoV-2 in samples from one tiger at the Bronx Zoo in New York City. This appears to be the first instance of a tiger being infected with COVID-19. On April 3, quantitative PCR testing for SARS-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) on duplicate respiratory tract samples from a four-year-old female Malayan tiger with respiratory signs that was living at the Wildlife Conservation Society’s (WCS) Bronx Zoo was performed at the Animal Health Diagnostic Center and New York State Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory at Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine and the University of Illinois College of Veterinary Medicine Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. Presumptive positive results of that testing were confirmed by the USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratory on April 4. The tiger was one of two Malayan tigers, two Amur tigers, and three African lions that developed respiratory signs over the course of a week; respiratory signs included a dry cough and, in some cases, wheezing, but no dyspnea or nasal or ocular discharge. Mild anorexia was also noted in some animals. All of the large cats are long-term residents of the zoo, do not have chronic medical conditions, and there have been no new animals introduced to the groups for several years. All other Amur and Malayan tigers, a snow leopard, cheetah, clouded leopard, Amur leopard, puma (Puma concolor), and serval at the zoo still appear healthy. The source of infection was presumed to be transmission from a zookeeper, who at the time of exposure had not yet developed symptoms of COVID-19. The zoo has been closed to the public since mid-March, and the first tiger began showing signs of being ill on March 27. All of these large cats are expected to recover. Other animals in other parts of the zoo have shown no clinical signs of disease. Enhanced biosecurity protocols have been implemented for staff caring for all nondomestic felids in the four zoos overseen by the WCS.Because infection of animals with SARS-CoV-2 meets the criteria of an emerging disease, such cases are reported to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE).

In the laboratory setting cats and ferrets were also able to transmit SARS-CoV-2 to other cats and ferrets, respectively. Golden Syrian hamsters were also able to be experimentally infected and were able to spread the infection to other hamsters. Dogs appeared to be susceptible to infection, but less so than cats or ferrets. Other preliminary laboratory findings indicate that poultry and pigs are not susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2.It is important to understand that experimentally induced infection does not mirror naturally induced infection. In other words, just because an animal can be experimentally infected via inoculation with high concentrations of purified tissue-cultured virus does not mean that it will be easily be infected with that same virus under natural conditions. The number of animals involved in these studies was also very small and conclusions were drawn based on data that, in some cases, were collected from as few as two animals. There is no evidence to suggest that animals, including pets, that may be incidentally infected by humans are playing a role in the spread of COVID-19. Human outbreaks are driven by person-to-person transmission.

As of April 17, two commercial laboratories in the United States reported they had tested thousands of specimens from dogs and cats for SARS-CoV-2 and had obtained no positive results. These specimens have come from the United States, South Korea, Canada, and Europe, including regions concurrently experiencing human COVID-19 cases. While this is encouraging, the specimens tested were originally submitted for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of more common pathogens causing respiratory disease in dogs and cats and, as such, per-case information as to whether or not these dogs and cats had contact with confirmed COVID-19 positive people is not available.Only a few animals with a known history of exposure to people with confirmed COVID-19 have been tested. With that in mind, the only pets incidentally exposed to COVID-19 that have tested positive, with confirmation, for SARS-CoV-2 are two pet dogs and a pet cat in Hong Kong. Another pet cat in Belgium tested positive, but details around that case are less clear. In each case, the pet was in the care of and had close contact with a person who had been confirmed to have COVID-19. Only in the case of the cat in Belgium was there a suggestion of the animal showing clinical signs of disease and, in that case, other diseases and conditions that could have caused those same signs of illness were not ruled out and there are also questions about how samples demonstrating the presence of SARS-CoV-2 were collected and evaluated. That cat recovered. As of March 31, 27 dogs and 15 cats from Hong Kong households in which one or more people were sick with COVID-19 had been held in quarantine. Only the 2 dogs and 1 cat mentioned above had positive results of testing for SARS-CoV-2 and none of the animals in quarantine had developed clinical signs of respiratory disease.To date, the CDC has not received any National Veterinary Service Laboratories (NVSL)-confirmed reports of pets or other animals becoming sick with COVID-19 in the United States, and there is no evidence to suggest that animals, including pets, that may be incidentally infected by humans are playing a role in the spread of COVID-19.

The AVMA, USDA, CDC, American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians (AAVLD), and National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians (NASPHV) do not recommend routine testing of animals for this virus. If a domestic animal becomes ill with respiratory or gastrointestinal signs, veterinarians are strongly encouraged to first test for common pathogens and conditions that are more likely to have caused such clinical signs.Discussion among key regulatory authorities and animal health experts (USDA, CDC, FDA, NASPHV, National Assembly of State Animal Health Officials [NASAHO], AVMA) indicates that testing may be justified for certain animals in the following situations:Because the situation is ever-evolving, animal and public health officials may decide to test certain animals meeting the above criteria. The decision to test will be made collaboratively between the attending veterinarian and local, state, and federal public health and animal and health officials, and your veterinarian will contact one of those officials for information about how to proceed. If samples are sent to state animal health, university, or private laboratories for initial testing, all samples should be collected by a licensed, and preferably USDA-accredited, veterinarian in duplicate because positive samples must be confirmed through additional testing by the USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL). Different states may also have different requirements for testing and collaborating with and reporting to public health and animal health officials.

If a domestic animal becomes ill with respiratory or gastrointestinal signs, veterinarians will first test for common pathogens and conditions that are more likely to have caused such clinical signs. If the results of tests for any of these common pathogens or conditions are positive, then the veterinarian will recommend treatment and care for that animal accordingly.If the results of tests for more common pathogens and conditions are negative, the veterinarian should contact a local, state, or federal public health or animal health official for information about how to proceed. Any decision to test an animal for SARS-CoV-2 will be made collaboratively with these officials and testing will generally only be done if there has been close contact between the animal and a COVID-19 positive person or if there is exposure of the animal to a high-risk environment where a human outbreak occurred, such as residence, facility (e.g., nursing home, prison), or cruise ship. Different states may also have different requirements for testing and collaborating with and reporting to public health and animal health officials.

Call your veterinarian with any questions about your animal’s health. You should tell them why you are concerned about your animal being ill (e.g., what clinical signs of illness you are seeing) and whether the animal has had close contact with someone who has been sick with COVID-19. Calling your veterinarian in advance will help your veterinarian determine whether your animal needs to be seen immediately and, if so, will support the veterinary clinic/hospital in preparing for the proper admittance of that animal, including the preparation of an isolation area as needed. Do not take the animal to a veterinary clinic/hospital until you have consulted with your veterinarian. A telemedicine consultation should be considered as an option as well.After an examination and evaluation of the animal to rule out more likely causes for the animal’s illness, veterinarians who believe an animal should be tested for SARS-CoV-2 will contact local, state, or federal public health or animal health officials, who will work with them to determine next steps.

At this time, there is no evidence to suggest that animals, including pets, that may be incidentally infected by humans are playing a role in the spread of COVID-19. However, as should be done for any animal introduced into a new environment, recently imported animals should be observed daily for signs of illness. If an animal becomes ill, the animal should be examined by a veterinarian. Call your veterinarian before bringing the animal into the clinic/hospital and let them know that the animal was recently imported from another country.

If you are sick with COVID-19 or another communicable disease, you should stay at home, minimizing contact with other people, until you are well. Accordingly, if this is a non-urgent appointment for your pet or service animal consider rescheduling that appointment until your physician and/or your public health official believe you no longer present a risk of transmitting your infection to other people you may encounter during such a visit, including owners of pets or other animals and veterinary clinic staff. If you are sick with COVID-19, and you believe your pet or service animal is ill, you should seek assistance from your veterinarian to determine how to best ensure your pet or service animal can be appropriately cared for while minimizing risks of transmitting COVID-19 to other people.Don’t forget—if you have an established relationship with your veterinarian (i.e., they have seen your pet/service animal in the recent past), telemedicine can be an excellent way to connect you, your pet/service animal, and your veterinarian. It can be used to help determine the urgency with which an animal needs to be seen, whether the animal needs to be seen in-person, and can also be used to conduct rechecks of certain types of ongoing medical problems. If this is your first visit to the veterinarian, it may also be possible to conduct your appointment via telemedicine, depending on what services are needed and any discretion that is being applied by regulatory officials under the COVID-19 emergency for the practice of veterinary medicine in your state.Be sure to contact your veterinarian before heading to the veterinary clinic/hospital to see what they recommend for your situation.

If you are sick with COVID-19 you need to be careful to avoid transmitting it to other people. Applying some common-sense measures can help prevent that from happening. Stay at home except to get medical care and call ahead before visiting your doctor. Minimize your contact with other people, including separating yourself from other members of your household who are not ill; use a different bathroom, if available; and wear a cloth face mask when you are around other people or pets and before you enter a healthcare provider’s office. Wash your hands often, especially before touching your face, and use hand sanitizer. Use a tissue if you need to cough or sneeze and dispose of that tissue in the trash. When coughing or sneezing, do so into your elbow or sleeve. The AVMA recommends you take the same common-sense approach when interacting with your pets or other animals in your home, including service animals. You should tell your physician and public health official that you have a pet or other animal in your home. As a precaution, it is recommended that people sick with COVID-19 limit contact with animals until more information is known about the virus. So, if you are ill with COVID-19, have another member of your household take care of walking, feeding, and playing with your pet. If you have a service animal or you must care for your pet, then wear a cloth face covering; don’t share food, kiss, or hug them; and wash your hands before and after any contact with your pet or service animal. You should not share dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels, or bedding with other people or pets in your home. Cats belonging to owners infected with COVID-19 should also be kept indoors as much as possible. While we are recommending these as good practices, there is no evidence to suggest that animals, including pets, that may be incidentally infected by humans are playing a role in the spread of COVID-19.

You should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would restrict contact with other people. Although there have not been reports of pets becoming sick with COVID-19 in the United States, it is still recommended that people sick with COVID-19 limit contact with animals until more information is known about the virus.

Identify another person in your household who is willing and able to care for your pet in your home should you contract COVID-19. Make sure you have an emergency kit prepared, with at least two weeks’ worth of your pet’s food and any needed medications. Usually we think about emergency kits like this in terms of what might be needed for an evacuation in the case of a disaster, but it’s also good to have one prepared in the case of quarantine or self-isolation when you cannot leave your home.

What should I do/not do during that walk?	Taking a walk helps support you and your dog’s good health, and can contribute to wellbeing for both of you. To observe social distancing, keep space of at least 6 feet between yourself and others who do not live in your home, do not gather in groups, and stay out of crowded areas. Dogs should be walked in the neighborhood in a way that allows for social distancing and keeps them safe. Avoid dog parks (many are currently closed) and other public places where groups of people and dogs may gather. To help maintain social distancing, do not let other people pet your dog when you are out for a walk.

COVID-19 appears to be primarily transmitted by contact with an infected person’s bodily secretions, such as saliva or mucus droplets in a cough or sneeze. It appears that COVID-19 can also be transmitted by touching a contaminated surface or object (i.e., a fomite) and then touching the mouth, nose, or possibly eyes, but this seems to be a secondary route. Smooth (non-porous) surfaces (e.g., countertops, doorknobs) transmit viruses better than porous materials (e.g., paper money, pet fur). Because your pet’s hair is porous, and fibrous, it is unlikely that you would contract COVID-19 by petting or playing with your pet. And, while we know that certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, we have no examples of where viruses have been transmitted by contact with pet hair or skin, including SARS-CoV-2. However, because pets can spread other diseases to people and people can also spread diseases to animals, it’s always a good idea to wash your hands before and after interacting with pets. There is no evidence to suggest that animals, including pets, that may be incidentally infected by humans are playing a role in the spread of COVID-19. Human outbreaks are driven by person-to-person transmission.While risk of transfer of SARS-CoV-2 from collars, leashes, and carriers also appears to be limited, it’s always a good idea to keep pet collars, leashes, and carriers clean and, fortunately, the SARS-CoV-2 virus is susceptible to routine cleaning. The Environmental Protection Agency has published a list of wipes, ready-to-use, and dilutable products for use against SARS-CoV-2.

If you have COVID-19 or are suspected of having COVID-19, staying in a different room from your baby is the safest way to keep your newborn healthy. A healthy caregiver should take care of the baby and can feed expressed breast milk. If you and your family decide to keep your baby in the same room as you, keep a distance of at least 6 feet from your baby when possible. When closer than 6 feet, wear a mask and make sure your hands are clean. Be sure not to touch the front of the mask, and change out the mask when it is damp. You can stop isolating yourself from your baby once you are fever-free without use of fever medicines (acetaminophen or ibuprofen) for at least 72 hours; when your other symptoms of COVID-19 are improving; and when at least 7 days have passed since your symptoms started.

Good hygiene (handwashing) and social distancing are the most effective ways to keep your infant safe from communicable diseases such as COVID-19. All caregivers should be reminded to wash hands thoroughly before touching bottles and other feeding supplies, and before feeding or caring for an infant or child. Continuing to follow all public health recommendations, lining up a symptom-free support person to help drop off supplies, and connecting with friends and family virtually (phone, text, FaceTime, social media) will limit the exposure of the virus/disease to you and your family. While screen time is typically not recommended for infants, connecting to loved ones via video chatting such as FaceTime is considered safe in limited amounts. Ways of keeping your children safe:• Wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.• Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer when handwashing is unavailable.• Reduce close contact with others by practicing social distancing. Limit public exposure and avoid unnecessary public contact.• If going out with the child is essential:o Cover the infant carrier (NOT THE INFANT) with a light-weight blanket, which helps protect the baby, but still gives them the ability to breathe comfortably.o Make the trip and time of coverage as brief as possible.o Do not leave the blanket on the carrier in the car or at any time when the baby and carrier are not in direct view by an adult caregiver.o Children only over the age of 2 should wear a mask or cloth face covering.• Keep your children away from others who are sick and keep them home if they are sick.• Teach kids to cough and sneeze into a tissue or their arm or elbow, not their hands.• Clean commonly used surfaces regularly with disinfectant. Clean commonly touched surfaces (e.g., countertops, tables, doorknobs) regularly with disinfectant.• Wash stuffed animals or other plush toys in the warmest water possible, being sure to dry them completely.• Teach children to avoid touching face.• Follow local and state guidance on travel and stay-at-home restrictions.

Yes. Breast milk provides protection against many illnesses and is the best source of nutrition for most infants. Breastfed infants are generally less likely to have severe respiratory symptoms if they get sick. Breastfeeding is good for moms, releasing hormones during breastfeeding that promote wellness and can relieve stress and anxiety. Breast milk is readily available, and especially important during emergencies. In limited studies on women with COVID-19 and another coronavirus infection, the virus has not been detected in breastmilk. For moms who are infected with COVID-19, breastfeeding directly and pumping breast milk to be fed via bottle by an uninfected caregiver are both options for providing the best nutrition (breast milk) to babies. COVID-19 spreads between people who are in close contact, mainly through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. Therefore, if the person feeding the baby by breast or bottle is COVID+, he/she should wear a face mask or mouth/nose covering and wash their hands before each feeding, as well as during breast milk pumping and/or any bottle preparation, to reduce the risk of transmission. All bottle, breast pump parts and supplies should be cleaned thoroughly following CDC guidelines. For more information please review resources about COVID-19 and breastfeeding provided by the Kansas Breastfeeding Coalition. As always, it is important to talk with your doctor and a breastfeeding support professional to weigh the risks and benefits and help determine what is best in an individual situation.

There is not enough information, research, or literature to definitively answer the question as to whether COVID-19 can cause problems during pregnancy. We also do not know if a pregnant woman with COVID-19 can pass the virus to her baby during pregnancy or delivery. There have been a very small number of newborns who have tested positive after being born to a mother with COVID-19, but due to an extremely small number of cases, studies still have not determined when the newborn became infected with the virus. It is unclear if it occurred in the womb, during the birthing process, or immediately after birth. The virus has not been found in samples of amniotic fluid, umbilical cord blood or breastmilk. It is critical that appropriate precautions are taken after delivery to prevent the spread of the virus from the mother to the infant. At this time, experts say there is no need to change the timing or method (cesarean vs. vaginal) of delivery to decrease the risk of spread to the infant. Overall, babies seem to do fairly well, with mild symptoms and good outcomes, although a limited study has shown infants to have a higher rate of severe disease than older children. In the rare case of infant death, it has not been determined if it was due to the virus or other underlying (original, or already existing) conditions. Updated: April 30, 2020

There is very little information at this stage, so we do not currently know if pregnant women are at greater risk of getting COVID-19. We do know that pregnant women experience changes in their bodies that may increase their risk for contracting some infections. We also know that pregnant women have had a higher risk of developing severe illness with viruses from the same family as COVID-19 and other viral respiratory infections such as influenza. Therefore, it is important for pregnant women to take extra precautions to protect themselves from illness and talk with their doctor. Updated: April 3, 2020

Yes. It is important to continue with regularly scheduled pediatric appointments and to continue with vaccinations as scheduled. These efforts will help protect your baby/child from other illnesses and will assure your baby/child grows and develops properly. Some providers may choose alternative options for routine check-ups for low-risk patients, such as altering the frequency or method of appointments (for example, offering appointments virtually via telehealth), or providing well-child and sick-child care at different times of the day or in separate spaces. Make sure that your contact information, including phone number and email, are always up-to-date with your healthcare providers so these changes can be communicated to you timely and easily.

The stores are all sold out. I want to wear one to protect myself when I go out in public.	Do not use surgical masks or N95 masks. These masks are considered specialized personal protective equipment (PPE) and should be reserved for first responders and health care workers to protect from serious injuries or illnesses while doing their jobs. If you have supplies of PPE, consider donating them. Homemade masks are NOT meant to replace proven public health strategies like staying home, social distancing and practicing good hygiene, which are all still the best ways to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. If used correctly, masks are simply another tool to help people who may have the virus -- but don’t know it -- from transmitting it to others. To use a homemade mask safely and effectively, remember this helpful acronym: M.A.S.K.M = Multi-layered, tightly-woven 100% cotton --180+ thread count. Don’t buy surgical or N95 masks.A = Avoid your face. Never touch the front of the mask. Always remove it from behind your head.S = Scrap it if it’s damaged, soiled or doesn’t fit. Make sure it’s breathable and fits snug. Don’t use while it’s damp, wet or dirty.K = Keep the mask and your hands clean. Wash your hands before and after use. Wash or dispose the mask after every use. Learn how to make a mask. Learn about children and masks.

New prints are required if staff previously working for school districts are transitioning to work in licensed child care facilities. The reason for this is that background check information cannot be shared between agencies or businesses (in this case, school and child care) and each may have specific prohibitions mandated by law.

Is KDHE processing background check requests? What if our local law enforcement agency has suspended non-criminal fingerprinting? Will there be a grace period?	Licensees must continue to submit the necessary request for background checks for individuals working, regularly volunteering, or residing in the facility. KDHE staff are working and affiliate names are being processed. Currently, all affiliate names are undergoing name-based records checks. This process is similar to the KDHE requirements prior to June of 2018. Name-based records checks include Kansas Bureau of Investigation (KBI) Kansas adult criminal and juvenile adjudications, Kansas sex offender registry, and the Kansas Department for Children and Families (DCF) child abuse and neglect registry.NOTE: For affiliates requiring comprehensive fingerprint-based checks, the automatic NORPLY email with the OCA numbers will continue to be sent. KDHE expects fingerprints to be completed within 90 days from the date the state of emergency is lifted (date not yet determined). However, for now licensees may disregard the “14-day requirement” that is stated in the OCA email. Please keep a record of the OCA number on file; it will be needed once fingerprinting resumes. Individuals who have lived outside of Kansas within the last five years will need to submit the necessary out-of-state request forms available on the KDHE Child Care Licensing Program website. During the COVID-19 State Disaster Emergency, individuals may begin working once the request for background checks has been submitted to KDHE. Updated: April 14, 2020

Are there resources to help?	We recognize that in some areas access to certain foods and supplies continues to be an issue. The Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) has been working with our statewide partners to identify needs and troubleshoot solutions. Many communities are already addressing the problem locally through partnerships with local public health and emergency managers.

To support licensees facing economic or other obstacles, Governor Kelly issued Executive Order (EO) 20-19 on April 9, 2020. Renewal dates are extended under the provisions of the order. A license that was effective and in good standing as of March 12, 2020, and that has expired or will expire during the COVID-19 State Disaster Emergency shall remain valid until 90 days following termination of the emergency declaration (date not yet determined). Licensees experiencing hardship may delay submitting a renewal application for up to 90 days following the end of the Governor’s emergency declaration. For those that are able to submit a renewal application, thank you. This helps KDHE staff accurately report out on the number of facilities and will help to reduce the backlog of renewals to be processed following termination of the emergency declaration.

In places including China, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan, fierce efforts to contain the virus appear to have reduced the number of new cases.
In the United States, the virus appears to be everywhere, and everyone now wants to know when we are going to be able to leave our homes and reopen the country. 
That’s the wrong way to frame it.The better question is: “How will we know when to reopen the country?”
Some cities or states will recover sooner than others. In an American Enterprise Institute report, Scott Gottlieb, Caitlin Rivers, Mark B. McClellan, Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization, without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days.
As for a vaccine, clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away.

"It’s felt a lot like 2008, hasn’t it? Peter S. Goodman, an economics correspondent for The Times, says there’s a key difference between that economic turmoil and today’s: the utter unpredictability of the outbreak’s spread. “The disaster feels eerily familiar, with trillions of dollars in wealth annihilated near-daily and deepening fears that businesses will fail,” he writes. “Yet the traditional policy prescriptions seem no match for the affliction at hand.”
The very means of controlling the health crisis — keeping workers home, limiting travel and disrupting commerce — risk making the economic crisis worse. 
“A sense of powerlessness is feeding the fear that is prompting investors to dump anything risky, which is in turn damaging economic prospects and reinforcing fear — a feedback loop,” he writes.

What’s that about?	"With the $2 trillion stimulus legislation passed by Congress on March 27, federal lawmakers agreed to provide $1,200 in direct payments to millions of Americans. How much you receive depends on your income. Single adults with Social Security numbers who have an adjusted gross income of $75,000 or less will get the full amount of $1,200. Married couples with no children earning $150,000 or less will receive a total of $2,400. And taxpayers filing as head of household will get the full payment if they earned $112,500 or less. For every qualifying child age 16 or under, the payment will be an additional $500.
If you earn above these income figures, the payment decreases until it stops completely for single people earning $99,000 or married people who have no children and earn $198,000. According to the Senate Finance Committee, a family with two children will no longer be eligible for any payments if their income is above $218,000. In any given family and in most instances, everyone must have a valid Social Security number in order to be eligible.

"The stimulus plan includes a significant expansion of unemployment benefits that would extend jobless insurance by 13 weeks. The program is aimed to help freelancers, part-time workers, furloughed employees and gig workers, such as Uber drivers, as well as full-time employees who have lost their jobs.
States have set their own rules for eligibility and benefits, which are generally calculated as a percentage of your income over the past year, up to a certain maximum. Some states are more generous than others, but unemployment typically replaces about 45 percent of your lost income. Under the plan, eligible workers would get an extra $600 per week on top of their state benefit.

What can I do?	"Student loans The Department of Education has granted a payment waiver of at least 60 days to many people. But it’s not necessarily automatic. In general, you have to call your loan servicer to request a waiver and to make sure that your loan is eligible. The waiver does not apply to private student loans. One big private lender, Sallie Mae, said it is offering suspension of payment for up to three months, with no damage to a borrower’s credit.
With the stimulus package, there will be automatic payment suspensions for any student loan held by the federal government until Sept. 30. It may be hard to contact many of the loan servicers right now, so check your account online in the coming weeks. 
Utility bills Some utility providers are offering to stop cutting people off for nonpayment. A number of large internet companies have agreed not to terminate residential or small-business customers who can’t pay their bills. Exact policies and requirements vary, though, so if you need help, you should call and ask.
Housing There’s also a good chance you can delay your mortgage payment if the outbreak has left you short of money. The Federal Housing Finance Agency has instructed mortgage servicers to allow borrowers whose mortgages are owned by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac to delay payments. If you rent, the best national resource we’ve found so far is the search-by-state function on Justshelter.org. This offers information on local organizations that can provide advice to renters in distress. 
Loans and credit Many consumer lenders are offering affected customers help if they can’t make payments.

"A coronavirus emergency relief package, passed by Congress in mid-March, gives qualified workers two weeks of paid sick leave if they are ill, quarantined or seeking a diagnosis or preventive care for the coronavirus, or if they are caring for sick family members. It gives 12 weeks of paid leave to people caring for children whose schools are closed or whose child care provider is unavailable because of the coronavirus.
Many workers at small and midsize companies and nonprofits can get the paid leave, as can government employees, as long as they’ve been employed at least 30 days. The law includes people who don’t typically get such benefits, like part-time and gig economy workers. But it excludes those at companies with more than 500 people, including many front-line employees at many major retailers and fast-food restaurants. 
Workers at places with fewer than 50 employees are included, but the Labor Department could exempt small businesses if providing leave would put them out of business.

When your body is exposed to a foreign pathogen, your body’s response is to produce antibodies, “which are proteins that can bind to the virus and help to deactivate it, clear it from circulation and prevent it from invading the body’s cells,” according to Dr. Jeffrey Jhang, medical director of clinical laboratories and transfusion services for the Mount Sinai Health System in New York. Those antibodies are contained in plasma, and the hypothesis is that extracting the plasma of a recovered patient then transfusing it into a sick patient may help that person recover more quickly.

If people who survived Covid-19 were known to be immune to the virus, they could venture back outside, and into the workforce, until a vaccine became available for everyone else. In particular, health care workers who are known to be immune could continue to care for severely ill people.
The quickest way to assess immunity to the coronavirus is a test that looks for protective antibodies in the blood of people who have recovered. But first you have to have the test.
Labs around the world are working on such tests, but none are readily accessible quite yet.

Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply.

"Some of the most important measures you can take to help manage anxiety, experts say, include staying informed on the facts, asking for help and practicing self-compassion. For some people, anxiety manifests in feeling helpless or underreacting to what they’re experiencing. Recognize your own agency and start taking care of the common-sense precautionary measures that are within your control, like stocking up on a couple of extra weeks’ supply of food or medication.  
Maintaining social connection, despite physical distance, is also important. Reach out to others via phone calls, emails or video chats, and talk through the feelings you’re experiencing. It’s important to be gentle with yourself, and maintain any kind of routine you can to have a sense of stability. Practice self-care, whether that means doing an at-home workout, baking, maintaining a regular religious practice or journaling. Focusing on these things can help bring some peace of mind.

Try to go 90 minutes without any screen time before bed -- that means no emails, social media or watching T.V. You can also take baby steps, beginning with 15 minutes, then working your way up. 
Working out, whether that means taking a socially distant walk or doing an at-home routine, can also help tire you out and dispel extra nervous energy. Taking a warm shower or bath 90 minutes before lights out may also help prime you for a better night’s sleep. Be sure to nix the coffee, alcohol and any eating before bed -- these things don’t promote quality rest. Finally, manage your anxiety through meditation, deep breathing techniques and, in some cases, medication.

Ms. Gottlieb recommends staying in the present as much as possible, versus thinking about the future or ruminating on things that haven’t happened yet. Try the “both/and” method: Let yourself feel your loss in the present while simultaneously promoting feelings of safety by taking actions like reading a book or video-chatting a friend.

Read a book, play a game, call a friend or just otherwise give yourself a break from the news to take care of your emotional and mental health.
Open your windows to let in some fresh air. To improve your indoor air quality, turn on the ventilation hood above your stove and open windows when cooking, if you can.

But in the long term, moderation is important. Your body’s physical stress response may affect what kinds of foods you are reaching for, drawing you more toward carbohydrates and foods that are high in fat. Take stock of how any stress and anxiety may have affected your eating habits. 
If you think you’re snacking too much when you’re not hungry, it may help to allow some time to pass and distract yourself with another activity before grabbing more food. Try to add some healthy snacks like fruits and vegetables into your routine, if you can. 
If you’re regularly not eating enough, find something you can tolerate eating, or drink a calorie-rich beverage, like a protein shake. If you’re forgetting to eat entirely, schedule your mealtimes into your calendar and treat meals like any other essential appointment.

"It’s a complicated question, right? Officials are telling us to stay indoors and away from others. At the same time, you need food or, as importantly, medicine. But what about the health of the delivery workers who come to your door? How do we keep each other safe?
For older Americans and those with health problems who are most at risk if they contract the coronavirus, having goods delivered makes sense. Some companies, like Postmates and Instacart, have begun offering non-contact or curbside deliveries. European companies are doing it, too.
Those services have a large network in place, though, which means their businesses are likely to thrive. Smaller retailers will not as Americans eschew restaurants, bars and specialty stores. That is why some restaurants are promoting delivery services as a way to stay in business, and why some cities that have ordered restaurants and bars to close have made exceptions for places providing delivery and takeout.
But what about delivery workers? Some groups, like Gig Workers Rising, are demanding that employers like Doordash and Instacart do more to protect them on the job. Recently, the group started a petition asking companies to provide paid time off to drivers who become sick during the coronavirus outbreak and cannot work.
The bottom line is this: Online deliveries are a boon for those who cannot leave their homes, as well as small restaurants who fear going out of business. But at the same time it comes with a risk to drivers and delivery workers who fear the loss of income if they get sick. At a minimum, everyone should generously tip their drivers for the service.

"The U.S. Postal Service, UPS and FedEx are still delivering the mail, but to continue doing so requires a healthy work force, and at least 20 postal workers have tested positive for the virus. Workers for UPS and FedEx share similar fears about contracting the virus, especially at warehouses where the mail is handled. Increasingly, letter carriers and delivery people are leaving packages on doorsteps and limiting close interaction with residents. 
A recent study found that the virus disintegrates over about 24 hours on cardboard, suggesting that packages may have only low levels of the virus — unless the delivery person has coughed or sneezed on it or has handled it with contaminated hands. If you are concerned about the risk, wipe down packages with disinfectant wipes and wash your hands.

Minimize bathroom breaks as much as possible.

How long will that take in the U.S.?	"No one knows. China began taking draconian measures to control the coronavirus in late January, and it was not until almost two months later that it reported no new local infections. South Korea did not lock down cities in the same way, but was extremely fast to test people, trace their contacts and quarantine infected people. And although China and South Korea have demonstrated that, with drastic actions, the virus can be brought under control, there is no guarantee it won’t resurge as their economies restart. 
The U.S. has taken a much more piecemeal approach to confronting the virus. To repeat the success of other countries, experts say, it will take extraordinary coordination and money from the government, and extraordinary trust and cooperation from citizens."

"Several states have already postponed their primaries. Officials in states that are going ahead with primaries have been trying to emphasize the new basics of voting hygiene, like using hand sanitizer at polling stations. 
And though the general election has yet to begin, it is already being profoundly shaped by the coronavirus, which has become the central issue between President Trump and the two major Democratic candidates, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. The pandemic’s effects on the economy have challenged Mr. Trump’s core message, that Americans are better off than before he took office. Mr. Biden has proposed a detailed plan for hospitals and research, echoing the language of presidents in past crises. He and Mr. Sanders curtailed their travel and canceled large gatherings like rallies. 
It would be enormously difficult to cancel or postpone the November general election, though.

"The federal government can impose quarantines under the Public Health Service Act to prevent the spread of communicable disease into the United States or between states. They’re considered a measure of last resort when there’s no other way to stop the spread of a deadly disease. On the state and local level, the laws vary depending on the region.
Still, the U.S. government doesn’t have the authority to impose a quarantine as sweeping as China, which confined some 70 million people in the largest effort in history. In the U.S., quarantines have been very rare. The last one was in the 1960s against a suspected smallpox outbreak. Health warnings are more common, like in 2016 when the C.D.C. advised pregnant women to avoid Southern Florida during an outbreak of the Zika virus.

While the W.H.O. is supposed to coordinate the global response to epidemics, the group, a U.N. agency, doesn’t have the authority to force countries to follow its plan.

South Korea has aggressively monitored infections, such as by checking the body temperatures of all incoming and outgoing passengers at train stations and other places. Officials operate drive-through testing centers and send out mobile phone alerts to citizens when new cases are reported in their districts. Singapore, which has focused on early diagnosis, isolation and contact tracing, has also seen its rate of new cases drop.
In China, new reported infections were cut to just 24 in a recent headcount from more than 3,500 a day in late January.

During the Cold War and after Sept. 11, 2001, the government devised emergency plans to protect government officials, like a nuclear bunker for Congress in West Virginia, now a tourist attraction. Those plans relied on the ability to gather lawmakers in a safe place together, however — a hazard during a pandemic. 
""There's no serious effort to grapple with what could happen in the event of a major catastrophe,"" said Norm Ornstein, a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute who pushed for plans in the wake of Sept. 11. He said that a bill to allow remote voting during a national crisis, put forward by Senators Rob Portman and Richard Durbin, was ""a good start.""
So far, congressional leaders have resisted calls for remote voting, calling it a bad precedent and saying they need to address the current crisis. They have instead looked for ways to practice social distancing within the Capitol. ""There's reason to be wary about a virtual Congress,"" Mr. Ornstein said, like ensuring cybersecurity and that Americans can still see and hear lawmakers at work.

"Complete disinfecting protocol includes four steps: wiping a surface of obvious dirt and residue; “dwell time” to let the disinfectant sit; wiping the surface clean; and rinsing with water. 
When disinfecting a surface, the most important consideration is what’s known as “dwell time”: the amount of time the disinfectant needs to remain on a surface to kill pathogens. These days, that means specifically the coronavirus that causes Covid-19. 
No disinfectant works instantly; most products sold to the public take 30 seconds to several minutes. To find out how long the recommended time is for a specific product, check the label. And note that some products may claim to sanitize — which means they reduce the level of certain bacteria, but not viruses.

Social distancing involves staying at least 6 feet away from other people to avoid catching or spreading a virus. It's a fancy term for avoiding crowds and minimizing physical contact. The safest thing to do during an outbreak is stay home as much as possible and minimize close contact with others. When you must go out, such as to shop for groceries, stay at least 6 feet away from others.

If you have had close contact with someone who has COVID-19, monitor yourself for symptoms for 14 days after the last day you were exposed to protect your health and those around you. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Other symptoms may include, muscle aches, fatigue, sore throat, chills, headache, runny nose, abdominal pain/discomfort, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. If you are 65 or older or have a medical condition (such as heart, lung, or liver disease, diabetes or cancer), or are on kidney dialysis, and you have been exposed to someone who has COVID-19—call your doctor. ▲ Top

By staying home and only going out into public for essential activities, such as grocery shopping or picking up medications, you will minimize your exposure to COVID-19, and fewer exposed people means fewer cases of the disease. At this time, slowing the rate of infection, or flattening the curve, remains very important. Flattening the curve means fewer people are sick all at the same time. This helps our hospitals from becoming overrun and unable to treat everyone who needs care.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends members of the general public wear a cloth face covering in light of new data about how COVID-19 spreads. The virus is thought to be spread mainly from person to person when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks.A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the person who is wearing it. But, wearing a cloth face covering may prevent the person wearing it from spreading COVID-19 to the people around them. Sometimes infected people don’t have symptoms. So even if you don’t feel sick, wearing a cloth face covering may help prevent you from spreading COVID-19 to those around you.To be effective, the cloth face covering should cover your nose and your mouth.

Wear a cloth face covering whenever you are out in the community, such as when getting groceries, medication or medical care. These face coverings help when you can’t avoid being in the same space as others. Wearing a cloth face covering does not mean you don’t need to stay away from others. Social distancing, or staying at least 6 feet from others, is still necessary to keep you and others safe.

"Yes. Wearing a cloth face covering is just a part of your overall protection plan to keep you and others from spreading and getting COVID-19. That plan includes:
Social distancing, or staying at least 6 feet away from other people
Frequent hand washing with soap and water for 20 seconds
Not touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands
Avoiding close contact with people who are sick
Staying home when you are sick
Covering your coughs and sneezes with a tissue

There is evidence that the novel coronavirus can be spread before an individual develops symptoms. This poses a problem because people who do not know they are infected may continue to go to work, school, and other public places. People who are sick and have symptoms are more likely to stay home, which means fewer opportunities for the virus to spread from one person to another. When asymptomatic transmission occurs, infection control experts and public health officials may need to take additional measures, such as social distancing, isolating patients, or using quarantines.

Wearing a cloth face covering in public will help prevent an infected individual from spreading the virus, but may not protect an individual from getting infected. It is still important to stay home and avoid crowds, practice social distancing (stay at least 6 feet apart) when in public, and wash hands properly and frequently. Recent studies have shown that individuals who are infected with COVID-19 may not show any symptoms, but can still spread the virus. In light of this new evidence, CDC now recommends wearing a cloth face covering when it is necessary to go out in public for essential errands such as getting groceries, medication, or other essential supplies. Cloth face coverings can be made from household items. Surgical masks and N-95 respirators are in short supply and should be reserved for healthcare professionals and other first responders. CDC recommends that face coverings be made out of breathable cloth such as 100 percent cotton, with two layers of fabric for optimal filtering. When held up to a bright light, the fabric should not let a lot of light shine through. Face coverings should:  Fit snugly but comfortably against the side of the face; Be secured with ties or ear loops; Allow for breathing without restriction; Be able to be laundered and machine dried without damage or change to shape;  As a reminder, face coverings are not a substitute for other preventive measures—continue to wash your hands properly, avoid touching your face, and maintain social distancing (stay at least 6 feet apart) in conjunction with wearing face coverings/masks in public spaces.

State and local authorities are carefully tracking the occurrence of COVID-19 in each community. Once  the number of cases starts to decline, federal, state, and local authorities will consider how to end social distancing and will likely do so gradually. The White House has released a three-phased approach to help state and local officials determine how and when to scale back social distancing guidance and continue to protect public health. Follow the advice of local public health authorities and continue healthy habits like washing your hands and avoiding touching your face.

COVID-19 is a new virus in humans, so it is too early to predict whether it will become seasonal. If it behaves like other respiratory viruses, including flu, it could abate as the weather gets warmer and become part of the usual cold and flu season. But scientists do not yet have enough information to know for certain. That’s why ongoing research to develop vaccines and antiviral drugs that are effective against coronaviruses is so important.

There are several ways that an outbreak can come to an end. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak was controlled through close coordination between public health officials and clinicians who were able to diagnose cases, isolate infected patients, trace their contacts, and implement strong infection control policies. An outbreak can dwindle once the virus has infected most of the people who are susceptible to it, because it has fewer targets, as was the case with the Zika virus outbreaks in recent years. If COVID-19 behaves like other respiratory viruses, including flu, it could abate as the weather gets warmer and may become part of the annual cold and flu respiratory season.

Older adults and people who have chronic medical conditions including heart disease, lung disease, diabetes, cancer, and hypertension are at higher risk for more serious COVID-19 illness and death. This is because our immune systems grow weaker as we age, which makes it more challenging for older adults to fight off infectious diseases. Chronic diseases are more common with age, can compromise the immune system, and make people more vulnerable to serious complications. Because of the rapid spread of COVID-19, the CDC recently issued a warning for people who are at the highest risk for serious illness from the virus. It is imperative older adults and others who are at high risk heed the advice of the CDC.

COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly between people in close contact with one another through respiratory droplets from coughs or sneezes. It may also be transmitted when you touch a surface or object with the virus on it, then touch your mouth, nose, or eyes. It is important to avoid people who may be infected. Older adults and those with underlying health conditions that can put them at increased risk should stay home to avoid being around others. Nursing homes and retirement and long-term care facilities should halt social visits. The White House advises that all individuals avoid:  Gatherings of more than 10 people; Non-essential air travel, and; Cruise ships (Note that major cruise lines have suspended trips and others are restricting passengers over the age of 70);  For older adults and adults with underlying health conditions, the CDC advises taking extra measures to put distance between yourself and others including:  Staying home whenever possible; Considering ways to get food, medicines, and essentials delivered to your home;  This is an important advisory to follow, because there is currently no vaccine available to prevent COVID-19 and no specific antiviral medication to treat it. The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to the virus. Proper handwashing is also imperative to preventing COVID-19 infection and spread. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, sneezing, or being in a public place. If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol. Avoid handshaking and touching high-traffic surfaces in public places–for example, elevator buttons, door handles, handrails, or counters. Use a tissue or your sleeve to cover your hand or finger if you must touch something. Avoid touching your face, nose, eyes, etc. To prevent the spread of the virus, it is important to stay home and avoid crowds. If you do need to go out in public, practice social distancing (stay at least 6 feet apart) and wear a cloth face covering to help prevent the spread of the disease to others. Surgical masks and N-95 respirators should not be used by the general public, as they are in short supply and should be used only by healthcare workers and caregivers who are taking care of infected individuals in close settings (at home or in a healthcare facility). Although there is no vaccine available to prevent COVID-19 at this time, you should still ensure that you and your family’s vaccinations are up to date, including influenza (flu) and pneumococcal (pneumonia) vaccines. This will help reduce the pressure on the healthcare system by reducing vaccine-preventable diseases.

Here are some important but simple steps you can take in preparing to remain at home for an extended period: Ask your physician or local pharmacy if ordering your medicines online is an option. Many online pharmacies (including national chains) will fill valid prescriptions and ship them directly to your door allowing you to avoid going to the pharmacy in person. CMS is also working with private plans to waive prescription drug refill limits and to relax restrictions on home or mail delivery of prescription drugs. However, only order from a reputable online pharmacy. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns consumers about rogue online pharmacies that claim to sell prescription medicines at deeply discounted prices. Read the FDA warning here. If you have questions, call a healthcare professional. Also, be sure you have over-the-counter medicines and medical supplies (fever reducers, tissues, hydrating beverages, etc.) to treat fever and other symptoms. Have enough basic household items and groceries on hand so you are prepared to stay at home for an extended period of time. Most major grocery chains have made it possible to order groceries online and have them delivered to your door. Check the websites of local or national grocery stores that may allow you to select your items online and then arrange for shipping. Keep in mind, however, that many of these services are experiencing delays due to the high volume of people choosing the safety of online ordering rather than in-person shopping. This means you will need to plan ahead. If you have questions or concerns about the delivery timeline, speak to a customer service representative. If you must go out for groceries, try to find a local grocery store that offers hours just for older adults. Most of these hours are earlier in the day and offer a chance for older adults to shop without as much exposure. Remember to cover your nose and mouth with a face covering, stay vigilant with handwashing, and avoid touching your eyes, mouth, and nose since COVID-19 can remain on certain surfaces for hours and in some cases, days.

Although COVID-19 can affect anyone, individuals at greater risk of severe illness from COVID-19 include the following:  Older adults (age 65 years and older); People with chronic medical conditions like heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and lung disease, including moderate to severe asthma; Those living in a nursing home or long-term care facility; People of any age with severe obesity (body mass index [BMI] >40);  Others who may be at high risk of more severe illness include those who are immunocompromised due to cancer treatment and other conditions. People of any age with severe obesity (body mass index [BMI] >40) or certain underlying medical conditions, particularly if not well controlled, such as those with renal failure or liver disease may also be at risk. Although COVID-19 does not appear to affect pregnant people differently than others, pregnant women are at greater risk of getting sick from other respiratory viruses than people who are not pregnant. If you are pregnant, be mindful about reducing your risk of getting sick and teach your family everyday steps (such as proper handwashing) to stay healthy. CDC maintains up-to-date information on those at higher risk of serious illness from COVID-19.

Children with COVID-19 may have mild, cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and cough, and some children experience vomiting and diarrhea. There have been some rare reports of children who have multi-system inflammatory syndrome (PIMS), which has been compared to Kawasaki disease or toxic shock syndrome. The American Academy of Pediatrics advises parents to call a pediatrician if their child has any of the following symptoms:  a fever that will not go away; abdominal pain, diarrhea, or vomiting; rash or changes in skin color; trouble breathing; the child seems confused or overly sleepy​;

The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly through close contact from person-to-person (within about 6 feet). It can be spread through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. Some recent studies have suggested that COVID-19 may be spread by people who are not showing symptoms, which is why face masks are recommended.

There are several types of tests currently available for COVID-19:  ; Molecular tests are used to detect the genetic material of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Molecular tests are fairly accurate and can be used to diagnose the disease.; ; Antigen tests are a new category of tests that can quickly detect fragments of the virus from nasal swabs. Antigen tests can provide results in minutes, but they are not as sensitive as molecular tests. Positive results from antigen tests are highly accurate, but negative results may need to be confirmed with a molecular test.; ; Antibody tests detect the body’s immune response to COVID-19. When the body is fighting an infection or has fought an infection, antibodies may be found in the blood. These tests do not detect the actual virus but are used to identify people who have been infected with the virus in the past.;  Some of the antibody tests have a high potential for false-negative and false-positive results. They may not be able to detect antibodies in the blood of someone who is newly infected, and they may not be able to distinguish SARS-CoV-2 from other coronaviruses. The presence of antibodies may indicate immunity from COVID-19, but that has not yet been conclusively proven; nor do scientists know the duration of protection. Antibody tests can help public health experts estimate how many people have been infected, and they may help scientists better understand the immune response to this new disease. The Food and Drug Administration has more information about tests used in the US.

Are there any protections for them if they don’t feel safe returning to work?	Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA), employees may refuse work if they “reasonably believe they are in imminent danger.” That fear typically includes the threat of death or serious physical harm. Generalized fear about the virus, that’s not based on fact, would not likely be sufficient to refuse to work. However, if the workplace currently has a number of confirmed cases of COVID-19, their fears may be justified. For workers who are at higher risk for negative outcomes if they contract COVID-19, such as those with underlying medical conditions or workers who are immunocompromised, even generalized fears may be legitimate. Businesses should work with these staff members to alter the work environment as much as possible to mitigate risk, if they can.

"The amount of loan forgiveness can be up to the full principal amount of the loan plus accrued interest. The actual amount of loan forgiveness will depend, in part, on the total amount spent over the covered period on: 
payroll costs including salary, wages, and tips, up to $100,000 of annualized pay per employee (for eight weeks, a maximum of $15,385 per individual), as well as covered benefits for employees (but not owners), including health care expenses, retirement contributions, and state taxes imposed on employee payroll paid by the employer (such as unemployment insurance premiums);
	 
owner compensation replacement, calculated based on 2019 net profit as described in Paragraph 1.b. above, with forgiveness of such amounts limited to eight weeks’ worth (8/52) of 2019 net profit, but excluding any qualified sick leave equivalent amount for which a credit is claimed under section 7002 of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) (Public Law 116-127) or qualified family leave equivalent amount for which a credit is claimed under section 7004 of FFCRA;
	 
payments of interest on mortgage obligations on real or personal property incurred before February 15, 2020, to the extent they are deductible on Form 1040 Schedule C (business mortgage payments);
	 
rent payments on lease agreements in force before February 15, 2020, to the extent they are deductible on Form 1040 Schedule C (business rent payments); and
	 
utility payments under service agreements dated before February 15, 2020 to the extent they are deductible on Form 1040 Schedule C (business utility payments).
 The Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary, has determined that it is appropriate to limit the forgiveness of owner compensation replacement for individuals with self-employment income who file a Schedule C to eight weeks’ worth (8/52) of 2019 net profit. This is most consistent with the structure of the Act and its overarching focus on keeping workers paid and will prevent windfalls that Congress did not intend. Congress determined that the maximum loan amount is based on 2.5 months of the borrower’s payroll during the one-year period preceding the loan. Congress also determined that the maximum amount of loan forgiveness is based on the borrower’s eligible payments—i.e., the sum of payroll costs and certain overhead expenses— over the eight-week period following the date of loan disbursement. For individuals with self-employment income who file a Schedule C, the Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary, has determined that it is appropriate to limit loan forgiveness to a proportionate eight-week share of 2019 net profit, as reflected in the individual’s 2019 Form 1040 Schedule C. This is because many self-employed individuals have few of the overhead expenses that qualify for forgiveness under the Act. For example, many such individuals operate out of either their homes, vehicles, or sheds and thus do not incur qualifying mortgage interest, rent, or utility payments. As a result, most of their receipts will constitute net income. Allowing such a self-employed individual to treat the full amount of a PPP loan as net income would result in a windfall. The entire amount of the PPP loan (a maximum of 2.5 times monthly payroll costs) would be forgiven even though Congress designed this program to limit forgiveness to certain eligible expenses incurred in an eight-week covered period. Limiting forgiveness to eight weeks of net profit from the owner’s 2019 Form 1040 Schedule C is consistent with the structure of the Act, which provides for loan forgiveness based on eight weeks of expenditures. This limitation will also help to ensure that the finite appropriations are directed toward payroll protection, consistent with the Act’s central objective. Finally, 75 percent of the amount forgiven must be attributable to payroll costs for the reasons specified in the First PPP Interim Final Rule."

Yes.  At least 75 percent of the PPP loan proceeds shall be used for payroll costs.  For purposes of determining the percentage of use of proceeds for payroll costs (but not for forgiveness purposes), the amount of any refinanced EIDL will be included.  The rationale for this 75 percent floor is contained in the First PPP Interim Final Rule.

"The proceeds of a PPP loan are to be used for the following. 
Owner compensation replacement, calculated based on 2019 net profit as described in Paragraph 1.b. above
Employee payroll costs (as defined in the First PPP Interim Final Rule) for employees whose principal place of residence is in the United States, if you have employees.
Mortgage interest payments (but not mortgage prepayments or principal payments) on any business mortgage obligation on real or personal property (e.g., the interest on your mortgage for the warehouse you purchased to store business equipment or the interest on an auto loan for a vehicle you use to perform your business), business rent payments (e.g., the warehouse where you store business equipment or the vehicle you use to perform your business), and business utility payments (e.g., the cost of electricity in the warehouse you rent or gas you use driving your business vehicle). You must have claimed or be entitled to claim a deduction for such expenses on your 2019 Form 1040 Schedule C for them to be a permissible use during the eight-week period following the first disbursement of the loan (the “covered period”). For example, if you did not claim or are not entitled to claim utilities expenses on your 2019 Form 1040 Schedule C, you cannot use the proceeds for utilities during the covered period.
Interest payments on any other debt obligations that were incurred before February 15, 2020 (such amounts are not eligible for PPP loan forgiveness).
Refinancing an SBA EIDL loan made between January 31, 2020 and April 3, 2020 (maturity will be reset to PPP’s maturity of two years). If you received an SBA EIDL loan from January 31, 2020 through April 3, 2020, you can apply for a PPP loan. If your EIDL loan was not used for payroll costs, it does not affect your eligibility for a PPP loan. If your EIDL loan was used for payroll costs, your PPP loan must be used to refinance your EIDL loan. Proceeds from any advance up to $10,000 on the EIDL loan will be deducted from the loan forgiveness amount on the PPP loan.
 The Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary, determined that it is appropriate to limit self-employed individuals’ (who file a Form 1040 Schedule C) use of loan proceeds to those types of allowable uses for which the borrower made expenditures in 2019. The Administrator has determined that this limitation on self-employed individuals who file a Form 1040 Schedule C is consistent with the borrower certification required by the Act; specifically, that the PPP loan is necessary “to support the ongoing operations” of the borrower. The Administrator and the Secretary thus believe that this limitation is consistent with the structure of the Act to maintain existing operations and payroll and not for business expansion. This limitation on the use of PPP loan proceeds will also help to ensure that the finite appropriations available for these loans are directed toward maintaining existing operations and payroll, as each loan that is made depletes the appropriation. Finally, although the Act makes businesses in operation on February 15, 2020 eligible for PPP loans, the Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary, has determined that self-employed individuals will need to rely on their 2019 Form 1040 Schedule C, which provides verifiable documentation on expenses between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2019. For individuals with income from self-employment from 2019 for which they have filed or will file a 2019 Form 1040 Schedule C, expenses incurred between January 1, 2020 and February 14, 2020 may not be considered because of the lack of verifiable documentation on expenses in this period. SBA will issue additional guidance for those individuals with self-employment income who: (i) were not in operation in 2019 but who were in operation on February 15, 2020, and (ii) will file a Form 1040 Schedule C for 2020."

How you calculate your maximum loan amount depends upon whether or not you employ other individuals. If you have no employees, the following methodology should be used to calculate your maximum loan amount: Step 1: Find your 2019 IRS Form 1040 Schedule C line 31 net profit amount (if you have not yet filed a 2019 return, fill it out and compute the value). If this amount is over $100,000, reduce it to $100,000. If this amount is zero or less, you are not eligible for a PPP loan. Step 2: Calculate the average monthly net profit amount (divide the amount from Step 1 by 12). Step 3: Multiply the average monthly net profit amount from Step 2 by 2.5. Step 4: Add the outstanding amount of any Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) made between January 31, 2020 and April 3, 2020 that you seek to refinance, less the amount of any advance under an EIDL COVID-19 loan (because it does not have to be repaid). Regardless of whether you have filed a 2019 tax return with the IRS, you must provide the 2019 Form 1040 Schedule C with your PPP loan application to substantiate the applied-for PPP loan amount and a 2019 IRS Form 1099-MISC detailing nonemployee compensation received (box 7), invoice, bank statement, or book of record that 7 establishes you are self-employed. You must provide a 2020 invoice, bank statement, or book of record to establish you were in operation on or around February 15, 2020.

Will unemployed be required to again begin looking for work?	After re-opening, the same unemployment insurance programs will remain available.  As is the case currently, individuals unemployed due to the pandemic will potentially remain eligible for unemployment insurance benefits.  The primary impact of reopening will be that if suitable work is available because an individual’s employer has reopened, but the individual chooses to not return to employment, they may be found ineligible for benefits.  Eligibility for future benefit payments is done on a case-by-case basis and could vary by situation.  Reopening, or the expiration of existing Executive Orders relating specifically to business operations, will not affect the Governor’s Executive Orders relating to items such as the temporary suspension of the unemployment insurance work search requirement.  These Orders will remain in force until the Governor specifically rescinds them.  There is not a sunset or expiration date on these particular orders.

The Emergency Economic Injury Grants. These grants provide an emergency advance of up to $10,000 to small businesses and private non-profits harmed by COVID-19 within three days of applying for an SBA Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL). To access the advance, you first apply for an EIDL and then request the advance. This Advance may be available even if your EIDL application was declined or is still pending and will be forgiven.

If you are an employee described above and can show that you have contracted COVID-19 through a work-related exposure, you may file a workers’ compensation claim for benefits including wage-loss, medical, and death benefits. If you are subject to quarantine per an order of a health care provider or public health officer, you may receive medical and wage-loss benefits for the quarantine period. Eligibility for wage loss benefits only applies if you are not eligible for wage-loss benefits from another source. For example, as of April 1, 2020, federal law mandates most employers provide paid leave for employees in quarantine (https://ndresponse.gov/covid-19-resources/covid-19-faqs).  As a result, this wage-loss benefit provides a safety net for those not already covered by another resource.  For quarantines prior to April 1, 2020, WSI will pay wage-loss benefits if you must use accrued PTO or sick leave for the quarantine period. However, if an employer grants additional leave or continues to pay wages for the quarantine period, WSI will not pay benefits.

No.  Generally, coverage for illnesses even when contracted through employment are not considered compensable injuries.

Even though it may be contended an employee contracted COVID-19 while working, the employee is not eligible for workers’ compensation benefits for this type of illness. On March 25, 2020, Governor Doug Burgum issued Executive Order 2020-12 for extending workers’ compensation coverage for COVID-19 to first responders and front-line health care providers. On April 16, 2020, Governor Burgum amended the order, Executive Order 2020-12.1, to include funeral service personnel. The executive order specifically alters the statutory application for three groups of employees in North Dakota: frontline health care workers, first responders, and funeral service personnel.

Person-to-person spread
	
The virus is thought to spread mainly from person to person.


Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about six feet).
	
Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.


Spread from contact with infected surfaces or objects
	
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.


Can someone spread the virus without being sick?
	
People are thought to be most contagious when they are most symptomatic (the sickest).
Some spread might be possible before people show symptoms. There have been reports of this occurring with this new coronavirus, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.

Employees may be eligible for both types of leave, but only for a total of twelve weeks of paid leave. They may take both paid sick leave and expanded family and medical leave to care for a child whose school or place of care is closed, or child care provider is unavailable, due to COVID-19 related reasons. The Emergency Paid Sick Leave Act provides for an initial two weeks of paid leave. This period thus covers the first ten workdays of expanded family and medical leave, which are otherwise unpaid under the Emergency and Family Medical Leave Expansion Act unless the employee elects to use existing vacation, personal, or medical or sick leave under the company’s policy. After the first ten workdays have elapsed, the employee will receive 2/3 of their regular rate of pay for the hours s/he would have been scheduled to work in the subsequent ten weeks under the Emergency and Family Medical Leave Expansion Act. Additionally, if an employee takes expanded family and medical leave, you must require them to provide you with documentation that supports the reason for taking this leave. This may include a notice that has been posted on a school, daycare, or government website, published in a newspaper, or an email notification sent by the school district, child care provider, etc. You should retain these documents for your records if you plan to claim a tax credit under FFCRA.

A non-exempt employee is paid based on the work performed, on an hourly, salary, daily and/or piece rate.  A non-exempt employee is entitled to an overtime rate for any hours worked over 40 in a single workweek.  An exempt employee is paid on a salary basis for the job performed, not the number of hours of work performed. An exempt employee is not entitled to overtime wages.

"Unfortunately, it’s unlikely that you will find coverage through your business disruption coverage. Generally, the triggering event for coverage would include physical damage; a pandemic is not considered physical damage. Also, under business disruption coverage there can be Civil Authority coverage, this too generally is triggered by physical damage.  Standard policies also usually contain an exclusion for viral pandemics or pandemics. These exclusions arose in or around 2003, during the SARs outbreak and are traditionally maintained in the standard language of commercial insurance. Keep in mind that policies can differ greatly, so it’s always important to talk with your licensed insurance agent to clarify exactly what is or is not included in your coverage. 
Business interruption insurance coverage protects against losses sustained due to periods of suspended operations; it pays loss of revenue that would have been earned if there was no business interruption. It typically provides coverage only if a physical loss to property occurs and may have specific exclusions for viral infections such as COVID-19.
Contingent business interruption insurance policies protect against losses from supply chain disruptions but may require the occurrence of property damage to trigger coverage. 
Event cancellation insurance provides coverage for expenses arising from delays, rescheduling or cancellations due to unforeseen covered events. Typically, contingent business interruption and event cancellation insurance policies exclude coverage for communicable diseases, such as COVID-19."

What should I do?	The North Dakota Department of Health will be conducting interviews with people that have been confirmed to have COVID-19 to determine who their close contacts are. Being in an indoor environment (e.g., store, workplace, restaurant) with someone who has COVID-19 is not necessarily considered having close contact. A close contact is defined as a person who spends a prolonged period of time within 6 feet (2 meters) of a person that has been diagnosed with COVID-19. Close contact can occur while caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a health care waiting area or room with someone that has been diagnosed with COVID-19.  The North Dakota Department of Health will be conducting interviews with all persons diagnosed with COVID-19 to determine who their close contacts are. People who are identified as close contacts will be notified by the North Dakota Department of Health and will receive instruction on quarantine and monitoring.  If you have not been contacted by the North Dakota Department of Health after you have been in the same location with a person diagnosed with COVID-19, you are not considered a close contact but should continue to follow social distancing guidance, good handwashing hygiene and staying home if you become sick. Any person with a fever and/or respiratory symptoms who was not tested, should stay home until at least 3 days (72 hours) have passed since recovery (fever-free without the use of fever-reducing medications) and improvement in respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath); and at least 10 days have passed since symptoms first appeared.

Being in an indoor environment (e.g., store, workplace, restaurant) with someone who has COVID-19 is not necessarily considered having close contact. A close contact is defined as a person who spends a prolonged period of time (10 minutes) within 12 feet (3.7 meters) of a person that has been diagnosed with COVID-19 up to 3 days prior to their illness onset. Close contact can occur while caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a health care waiting area or room with someone that has been diagnosed with COVID-19. Just being in an indoor environment with someone is not necessarily a close contact. The North Dakota Department of Health will be conducting interviews with all persons diagnosed with COVID-19 to determine who their close contacts are. People who are identified as close contacts will be notified by the North Dakota Department of Health and will receive instruction on quarantine and monitoring. Click this link for a fact sheet on being a Close Contact. If you have not been contacted by the North Dakota Department of Health after you have been in the same location with a person diagnosed with COVID-19, you are not considered a close contact but should continue to follow social distancing guidance, good handwashing hygiene and staying home if you become sick. Click this link for a fact sheet for people who may have been around someone with COVID-19 but are Not a Close Contact.  Any person with a fever and/or respiratory symptoms who was not tested, should stay home until at least 3 days (72 hours) have passed since recovery (fever-free without the use of fever-reducing medications) and improvement in respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath); and at least 10 days have passed since symptoms first appeared. For anyone wishing to self-monitor their temperatures, here is a tool to help you do that.

"There are several reasons your claim could be denied, but it is important to remember that with the new federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) and Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC), almost all individuals will be eligible for benefits if they are unemployed due to the pandemic.  The federal government considers PUA and PEUC to be programs of last resort.  This means that they are only available to individuals who are not eligible for regular state unemployment insurance, or those who have been denied regular state unemployment insurance. Following are some details explaining why you may have been denied regular UI benefits and what you should do next: 
Your earnings do not qualify you for regular unemployment insurance benefits
	
If you receive a Monetary Determination noting that you are not eligible for benefits, you should file a claim using the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance link.


You filed a claim less than a year ago but you have used up all of your benefits (exhausted your claim)
	
If you have received all of the benefits available to you on a claim you filed within the last year, you should file a claim using the Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation link.


You are unemployed for a reason other than the pandemic
	
If you are unemployed for a reason not related to the pandemic, you will need to follow normal procedures in place for state unemployment insurance benefits (click “File a Regular UI Claim”).  The most common reasons for these types of denials will be if you quit a job or were terminated by your employer.  You will be notified of your eligibility with a Non-Monetary Determination.  This determination will provide you with information and actions you should take if you do not agree with the determination.

Because of the many programming changes associated with new programs introduced in the CARES Act, Job Service North Dakota recognizes the critical need to get each of these programs in place. We had to prioritize the order of programming all while weighing the risk of complete system failure, which could have resulted in the inability to provide any individual a benefit payments at all.  We also took into account the fact that no benefits would be lost by anyone if we could not find a way to program it. At this time, the federal government still has not provided the guidance necessary to program the new CARES Act programs and has told the states not to act until they have completed it.  We have updated our systems to accept claim applications to PUA and PEUC but will not be processing these types of applications until we receive guidance from the US Department of Labor. We have waived the waiting week and are currently back paying UI claims filed March 8 through April 4.

There are discussions underway at both the state and federal level about finding a way to make this pandemic a triggering event. While that would potentially bring coverage, it would have a massive effect on the insurance industry. Insurance is a product that is risk rated and sold based on those risks that are covered in the policy. This type of event was excluded from many policies, and to retroactively enact coverage would put the entire insurance industry at risk of insolvency. This move could also lead to dramatic rate increases, which could also make insurance unaffordable to businesses as we look to recover from this pandemic.  Additionally, the government retroactively amending contracts (insurance agreements) would also face significant constitutional issues and would ultimately be challenged in court.  The best option at this point may be to explore what resources are available in North Dakota and through the federal government.

A short-term medical plan is a temporary health insurance policy typically offering “bare-bones” coverage designed for use during unexpected coverage gaps. An individual can only hold a short-term medical plan for a short period of time, less than one year. These plans are nonrenewable. Furthermore, they do not meet the coverage requirements of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), meaning an individual may have to pay a monetary penalty for not carrying acceptable health insurance coverage. With the regulations established by the ACA, short-term medical, limited benefit and discount medical plans have become increasingly popular. However, consumers must be aware of what they are purchasing before replacing their comprehensive major medical coverage with one of these options.

Contact lens users not only touch their eyes multiple times a day, they also touch their face much more often than people who don’t wear contacts, said Dr. Thomas Steinemann, clinical spokesman for the American Academy of Ophthalmology.

Is it safe to go for a walk or exercise outside if someone jogs or bikes past me?	"Coronavirus cannot travel very far in the air, the World Health Organization says.
The virus is mainly spread through small droplets from an infected person’s nose or mouth, which get released when a person coughs, sneezes or speaks. 
These droplets “are relatively heavy, do not travel far and quickly sink to the ground,” the WHO said. 
While the wind isn’t a big risk factor, contaminated surfaces are. Those respiratory droplets can land on surfaces such as tables, doorknobs and handrails — and subsequently infect others who touch those surfaces and later touch their eyes, nose or mouth. 
That’s why wearing a face mask won’t necessarily protect you from coronavirus. The primary benefit of wearing a mask is to protect others if you’re sick or an asymptomatic carrier of the virus."

The swine flu, or H1N1, “was very contagious and infected some 60 million people in the United States alone within a year,” Gupta said. “But it was far less lethal than the flu even — like 1/3 as lethal as the flu.” 
What makes the novel coronavirus different is that “this is both very contagious … and it appears to be far more lethal than the flu as well,” Gupta said. “So both those things, in combination I think, are why we’re taking this so seriously.”"

"Singapore was initially praised for its clampdown on the virus. Even people who had no symptoms but tested positive had to be hospitalized until they tested negative. 
But Singapore was also relaxed, allowing businesses, churches, restaurants and schools to stay open during its first wave of the virus. And some communities were overlooked by government testing.
The number of cases in Singapore shot up, and the country suffered a strong second wave of coronavirus. 
By contrast, Germany, South Korea, Iceland and Taiwan have been able to suppress the virus. They also have among the lowest death rates from Covid-19 in the world. 
Taiwan was proactive, launching its Central Epidemic Command Center before the island even confirmed its first infection. 
Iceland required all its citizens returning to the country to undergo 14 days of quarantine – regardless of which country they traveled from.
Germany and South Korea quickly launched widespread testing and have some of the highest per-capita testing rates in the world. Their ability to identify and isolate those infected has helped prevent deadlier outcomes."

"The novel coronavirus is dangerous for several reasons, even if the number of deaths might not have matched that of the flu.
Since this flu season started October 1, an estimated 24,000 to 62,000 Americans have died from the flu, according to CDC. Nationwide, the flu has infected at least 39 million people between October and early April. 
The first US case of coronavirus was reported in January, and the first US death from coronavirus was reported in late February. By April 16, the US had more than 639,600 cases of coronavirus, and more than 30,900 people have died.
There are important factors to consider when comparing the flu vs. coronavirus: 

The CDC estimates for the flu go back to October 2019. But the first US case of coronavirus didn’t emerge until several months later.
Coronavirus is twice as contagious as the flu. Research indicates a person with the flu infects an average of 1.28 other people, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said. But with coronavirus, “it’s likely between 2 and 3” other people.
Coronavirus infections have a “very high mortality rate – one in six – among people who are over 80 and people with underlying chronic disease,” epidemiologist Dr. Abdul El-Sayed said. 
People with coronavirus might not get symptoms for 14 days, and some get no symptoms at all. But during that time, they’re still contagious and can infect others unknowingly. 
A vaccine is available for the flu, but no vaccine is available for coronavirus. Experts say the number of flu deaths could be drastically reduced if more people got their flu shots. But about half of Americans don’t get vaccinated, including most children who die from the flu."

If we isolate all the asymptomatic carriers, couldn’t the rest of us go back to work?	"Doctors say it’s not realistic to test all 328 million people in the US, especially since many states are still struggling to get enough tests or testing supplies.
So in order for the economy to reopen and stay open, the US will need to triple its number of tests performed every day — from 150,000 tests a day to at least 500,000, three Harvard researchers found.
And the proportion of test results that come back positive needs to be much lower. About 20% of US test results have been positive, which is “clearly way too high,” said Dr. Thomas Tsai, one of the Harvard researchers. 
The World Health Organization said an adequate range of positive test results would be 3% to 12%. Germany and South Korea have already met that goal, Tsai said."

Do I need to wash my clothes right after encountering other people, like at the grocery store or while jogging?	"“I don’t think you need to,” CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said. 
Coronavirus can stay alive for up to three days on stainless steel and plastic. But clothing “is probably more like cardboard — it’s more absorbent, so the virus is unlikely to stay and last that long,” Gupta said. 
While covonravirus can stay alive on cardboard for up to 24 hours, viruses generally don’t stick well on surfaces that are in motion. 
“If you look at how viruses move through air, they kind of want to move around objects,” Gupta said. “They don’t want to necessarily land on objects. So if you’re moving as human body through the air … (it’s) unlikely to stick to your clothes.”"

"“There is no evidence that COVID-19 can be spread to humans through the use of pools and hot tubs,” the CDC says. 
“Proper operation, maintenance, and disinfection (e.g., with chlorine and bromine) of pools and hot tubs should remove or inactivate the virus that causes COVID-19.”
But health officials still advise staying at least 6 feet away from others because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease. In other words, you probably won’t get coronavirus from the water, but you could get coronavirus from someone close to you in the water. 
As for drinking water, doctors say you don’t need to worry about coronavirus in the tap water because most municipal drinking water systems should remove or inactivate the virus."

"It’s easy for asymptomatic people to spread coronavirus, said Dr. Anne Rimoin, an epidemiology professor at UCLA’s School of Public Health.
“When you speak, sometimes you’ll spit a little bit,” she said. “You’ll rub your nose. You’ll touch your mouth. You’ll rub your eyes. And then you’ll touch other surfaces, and then you will be spreading virus if you are infected and shedding asymptomatically.”"

"“Viruses can live on surfaces and objects — including on money — although your chance of actually getting COVID-19 from cash is probably very low,” emergency room physician Dr. Leana Wen said.
The new coronavirus can live for up to 72 hours on stainless steel and plastic, up to 24 hours after landing on cardboard, and up to four hours after landing on copper, according to a study funded by the US National Institutes of Health. 
So how do you protect yourself? Use contactless methods of payment whenever possible, Wen said.
If you can’t use a contactless form of payment, credit cards and debit cards are much easier to clean and disinfect than cash. But remember that anyone who touches your credit card can also leave germs on it.
If you must use cash, “wash your hands well with soap and water” afterward, Wen said. And since this is a respiratory virus, make sure you avoid touching your face."

“There are actually six other coronavirus – MERS and SARS and four other viruses that create the common cold. They don’t seem to do very well at creating long-term immunity,” Brilliant said. 
“But we need to find out whether we can create a vaccine that creates more immunity [to the novel coronavirus] than the disease does. And that’s not so wild. Many of the vaccines that we’ve made in history are actually stronger than the virus is itself at creating immunity.”"

“We all want to open up as soon as it’s safe to do so. But that’s the key part — as soon as it is safe to do so.”
Some states enacted social distancing rules later than others. So “we’re going to see states like Florida … peaking, I think, much farther down the line,” Jha said.
But even California — one of the earliest states to enact a shelter-in-place order — might not be ready by May 1, said Dr. Anish Mahajan, chief medical officer at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. 
“May 1 would seem premature to lift the stay-at-home orders,” the Southern California doctor said. “Local modeling, regional modeling suggest that if we were to lift the stay-at-home orders at this stage, we would again see a resurgence of infections at a high rate.”
The US might have to practice intermittent social distancing measures until 2022 if a vaccine isn’t publicly available by then, researchers at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health said.

What if I only smoke weed?	"This is not a good time to be vaping or smoking anything, including weed. 
“Vaping affects your lungs at every level. It affects the immune function in your nasal cavity by affecting cilia, which push foreign things out,” said Prof. Stanton Glantz, director of the Center for Tobacco Research Control and Education at University of California San Francisco.
When you vape, “the ability of your upper airways to clear viruses is compromised,” Glantz said.
Tobacco smokers are at especially high risk. In a study from China, where the first Covid-19 outbreak occurred, smokers were 14 times more likely to develop severe complications than non-smokers.
Even occasionally smoking marijuana can put you at greater risk.
“What happens to your airways when you smoke cannabis is that it causes some degree of inflammation, very similar to bronchitis, very similar to the type of inflammation that cigarette smoking can cause,” said pulmonologist Dr. Albert Rizzo, chief medical officer for the American Lung Association.
“Now you have some airway inflammation, and you get an infection on top of it. So yes, your chance of getting more complications is there.”"

“I just want to make sure everybody knows that no matter what their age is, it can seriously affect them. And it can seriously mess them up, like it messed me up,” the Iowa teen said. 
He started feeling sick on St. Patrick’s Day, with just a small cough. “I thought at first it was just a normal cold. And then it started progressively getting worse,” he said. 
“Four days in, the really bad symptoms started coming along. I started having really bad outbreaks, like sweating, and my eyes were really watery. I was getting warmer and warmer, and I was super fatigued. … I would start experiencing the worst headaches I’ve ever felt in my life. They were absolutely horrible.”
Eventually, the teen had to be hospitalized. His mother said she worried he might “fall asleep and never wake up.”

If so, how do I make one?	"The CDC recently changed its guidance on wearing face masks as more studies about asymptomatic spread pile up.
Now, the CDC “recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies).”
But there are several important caveats and key points: 

The public should NOT buy surgical masks or N95 respirator masks. Those are desperately needed by health care workers who are in close contact with coronavirus patients every day. 
Instead, make your own cloth mask — it’s easy, and you don’t have to sew. US Surgeon General Jerome Adams shows how to make face masks with just a T-shirt and rubber bands in this CDC video. You can also use a bandana and a coffee filter. 
Don’t be fooled: The main benefit of wearing masks in public isn’t to protect you from getting sick. Rather, it’s to protect others from yourself if you’re sick or you’re an asymptomatic carrier. “This is more for people who might be infected and don’t know it, and to try and lower the likelihood that they will spread this to somebody else,” CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said. The CDC agreed.
You can definitely still get coronavirus even if you wear a mask. The virus can stay alive on surfaces for up to 3 days, and it’s easy to touch your face whenever you’re not wearing a mask. Also, people often adjust face masks frequently, leading to more touching of the face — a common way that coronavirus spreads.
It’s important to wash your cloth mask after every use. Here’s how. 
Wearing cloth masks is just “an additional, voluntary public health measure,” the CDC said. To protect yourself from getting coronavirus, it’s critical to stay 6 feet away from others, wash your hands frequently for at least 20 seconds each time, and stop touching your face."

Does the viral load matter?	"Many health care workers don’t actually have enough protective gear to handle the growing influx of coronavirus patients. 
Some have resorted to using plastic report covers as masks. The CDC said medical providers might have to use expired masks or reuse them between multiple patients. (This shortage is why the general public should not buy medical masks and instead make cloth masks at home.)
But it’s not just subpar protective gear that puts medical workers at risk. It’s also the amount of virus they’re exposed to. 
“The viral load — the amount of virus – does determine the severity of your illness,” emergency room physician Dr. Leana Wen said. “So that could happen in the case of health care workers who are exposed to a lot more Covid-19 as a result of their work — that they get more severely ill.”"

“So even when you suppress or stabilize the number of new infections, it’s still going to take a while before you see a decrease in hospitalizations, a decrease in intensive care, and a decrease in deaths.

“At this point in time, there is no evidence that domestic animals, including pets and livestock, can spread COVID-19 to people.”
That statement came after the Bronx Zoo said a tiger was infected by a zoo employee who was “asymptomatically infected with the virus.” The zoo had been closed to the public since March 16.
The AVMA said “out of an abundance of caution, and until more is known about this virus, you should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19.”
“If you have a service animal or you must care for your animals, including pets, wear a cloth facemask; don’t share food, kiss, or hug them; and wash your hands before and after any contact with them,” the veterinary association said.

“These findings explain the rapid geographic spread of (coronavirus) and indicate containment of this virus will be particularly challenging,” researchers wrote.
In mid-March, the CDC said almost half of the 712 people with coronavirus who were on the Diamond Princess cruise ship didn’t have any symptoms when they tested positive.
And recent studies suggest 25% to 50% of coronavirus carriers don’t have symptoms.
In the US, “I think it could be as many as 1 in 3 walking around asymptomatic,” said New Jersey primary care physician Dr. Alex Salerno.
“We have tested some patients that have known exposure to COVID (coronavirus disease). They did not have temperature. Their pulse/(oxygen) was OK.”
Aside from social distancing and frequent hand washing, Salerno said more testing of people without symptoms is essential.
When asymptomatic carriers test positive, “we isolate them, and we separate them from the people who are not positive,” Salerno said. If more asymptomatic people got tested, “we could get people back to work safely.”

Those patients should get plenty of rest, hydrate frequently and take fever-reducing medication.
“The current guidance – and this may change – is that if you have symptoms that are similar to the cold and the flu and these are mild symptoms to moderate symptoms, stay at home and try to manage them,” said Dr. Patrice Harris, president of the American Medical Association. 
But about 20% of coronavirus patients get advanced disease. “Older patients and individuals who have underlying medical conditions or are immunocompromised should contact their physician early in the course of even mild illness,” the CDC says.

“The necessary temperature would also be based on the materials of the surface, the environment, etc.”
President Donald Trump suggested this coronavirus could subside by the warmer summer months, but scientists say it’s too early to tell. And the fact that coronavirus keeps spreading in the Southern Hemisphere during its summer months suggests this strain might not succumb to warmer temperatures. 
“The short answer is that while we may expect modest declines in the contagiousness of (novel coronavirus) in warmer, wetter weather … it is not reasonable to expect these declines alone to slow transmission enough to make a big dent,” wrote Dr. Marc Lipsitch, director of the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics at Harvard’s T.H.

There are several reasons hospitals are on track to face dire shortages, said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert and professor at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. 
“About 20 or 30 years ago, we decided that we would not over-hospitalize,” Schaffner said.
Back then, hospitals often had empty hospital beds for new patients. But now, many hospitals are “absolutely full,” Schaffner said. “We have under-built hospital beds because they are very expensive.”
Also, Americans have grown accustomed to “just-in-time” ordering. But that becomes a huge problem when international supply chains are disrupted by an outbreak. “We didn’t anticipate international turbulence influencing this,” Schaffner said.

"Experts say it’s due to cuts in federal funding for public health and problems with early testing. 
Problems with public health infrastructure Two years ago, the CDC stopped funding epidemic prevention activities in 39 countries, including China. This happened because the Trump administration refused to allocate money to a program that started during the 2014 Ebola outbreak. 
Former CDC director Dr. Tom Frieden warned that move “would significantly increase the chance an epidemic will spread without our knowledge and endanger lives in our country and around the world.”
Problems with the testing Malfunctions, shortages and delays in availability have all contributed to the slowdown. 
In the first few weeks of the outbreak in the US, the CDC was the only facility in the country that could confirm test results — even though a World Health Organization test became available around the same time.

It’s still possible to pick up coronavirus on the bottoms of your shoes by running errands, but it’s unlikely you’ll get sick from it because people don’t often touch the soles of their shoes and then their faces. Because Covid-19 is a respiratory disease, the CDC advises wearing a mask while in public and washing your hands frequently– the correct way.

“They call that the pre-symptomatic period. So people tend to have more virus at that point seemingly in their nose, in their mouth. This is even before they get sick. And they can be shedding that virus into the environment.”
Some people infected with coronavirus never get symptoms. But it’s easy for these asymptomatic carriers to infect others, said Dr. Anne Rimoin, an epidemiology professor at UCLA’s School of Public Health.
“When you speak, sometimes you’ll spit a little bit,” she said. “You’ll rub your nose. You’ll touch your mouth. You’ll rub your eyes. And then you’ll touch other surfaces, and then you will be spreading virus if you are infected and shedding asymptomatically.”

Touching contaminated hair and then touching your mouth, eyes or nose could increase your risk of infection. “Like on the skin, this coronavirus is a transient hitchhiker that can be removed by washing,” Aronoff said.
But that doesn’t mean you have to wash the hair on your head multiple times a day, said dermatologist Dr. Hadley King. 
That’s because “living hair attached to our scalps may be better protected by our natural oils that have some antimicrobial properties and may limit how well microbes can attach to the hair,” she said. 
“If you are going out into areas that could possibly be contaminated with viral particles, then it would be reasonable to wash the hair daily during the pandemic. But it’s not the same as hand washing – the virus infects us through our mucosal surfaces.  If your hair is not falling into your face or you’re not running your fingers through it, then there is less of a risk.”
If your hair does fall into your face, you may want to pull it back to minimize your risk, King said.
As for facial hair, “washing at least daily if not more frequently is wise, depending on how often they touch their face,” Aronoff said."

Warm water is perfectly fine for washing your hands — as long as you wash them thoroughly (like this) and for at least 20 seconds. (To time yourself, you can hum the “Happy Birthday” song twice or sing a couple of verses from any of these hit songs from the past several decades.)
Cold water will also work, “but you have to make sure you work really vigorously to get a lather and get everything soapy and bubbly,” said chemist Bill Wuest, an associate professor at Emory University. To do that, you might need to sing “Happy Birthday” three times instead of twice.

"No. More people have died from coronavirus in the US since February than from the flu since October. 
In other words, coronavirus isn’t just killing more people than the flu. It’s also killing at a much faster rate.
From October 1 to April 4, an estimated 24,000 to 62,000 Americans died from the flu, according to CDC. 
The first known US death from coronavirus was in February. By May 13, more than 83,600 people have died, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
There are other reasons why coronavirus can be more dangerous than the flu:

Coronavirus is twice as contagious as the flu. Research indicates a person with the flu infects an average of 1.28 other people, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said. But with coronavirus, “it’s likely between 2 and 3” other people. But mitigation efforts such as stay-at-home orders can drastically reduce that number. 
Coronavirus can be spread unknowingly for many more days than the flu. People with coronavirus might not get symptoms for 14 days, and some get no symptoms at all. But during that time, they’re still contagious and can infect others unknowingly. But the incubation period for the flu is much shorter, and most people get symptoms within two days of infection.
A vaccine is available for the flu, but no vaccine is available for coronavirus. Experts say the number of flu deaths could be drastically reduced if more people got their flu shots. But about half of Americans don’t get vaccinated, including most children who die from the flu."

If I don’t have disinfecting wipes, can I use soap and water on surfaces?	"Yes, you can use soap and water on surfaces just like you would on your hands to kill coronavirus. But don’t use water alone — that won’t really help. 
The outer layer of the virus is made up of lipids, aka fat. Your goal is to break through that fatty barrier, forcing the virus’ guts to spill out and rendering it dead. 
In other words, imagine coronavirus is a butter dish that you’re trying to clean. 
“You try to wash your butter dish with water alone, but that butter is not coming off the dish,” said Dr. John Williams, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh. 
“You need some soap to dissolve grease. So soap or alcohol are very, very effective against dissolving that greasy liquid coating of the virus.”
By cutting through the greasy barrier, Williams said, “it physically inactivates the virus so it can’t bind to and enter human cells anymore.”"

Do plasma donors and their recipients have to have the same blood type for this treatment?	"Convalescent plasma is the liquid part of blood from patients who have recovered from an infection, the US Food and Drug Administration says. “Antibodies present in convalescent plasma are proteins that might help fight the infection.”
But just like with normal blood donation, donors and recipients must be matched by blood type. Type AB plasma is the only universal type and can be given to patients of any blood type. 
The FDA said patients who are fully recovered from Covid-19 for at least two weeks are encouraged to consider donating plasma.
The Red Cross said there are other requirements for plasma donors: 

You are at least 17 years old and weigh at least 110 pounds. (The age requirement may differ according to organization and state). Other weight requirements apply for donors age 18 or younger.
You must be in good health overall health now. 

 You cannot donate if you are pregnant or have certain conditions, such as HIV or sickle cell disease.

The risk depends on where you  are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there. For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places around the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to comply with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in China and some other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It’s important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go. WHO publishes daily updates on the COVID-19 situation worldwide.

Illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for children and young adults. However, it can cause serious illness: about 1 in every 5 people who catch it need hospital care. It is therefore quite normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19 outbreak will affect them and their loved ones. We can channel our concerns into actions to protect ourselves, our loved ones and our communities. First and foremost among these actions is regular and thorough hand-washing and good respiratory hygiene.

Dessa innebär bland annat att du har personligt ansvar och bör undvika större sociala sammanhang där flera personer träffas, så som fester, bröllop, begravningar och andra tillställningar. Det är också viktigt att du håller avstånd till andra människor på exempelvis idrottsplatser, gym, köpcentrum, i kollektivtrafiken med mera. Personer som är 70 år och äldre bör vara särskilt försiktiga.
Alla verksamheter i Sverige är också skyldiga att, utifrån Folkhälsomyndighetens eller smittskyddsläkarens rekommendationer, vidta åtgärder för att minska risken för smittspridning. Detta kan till exempel innebära att:

Butiker, köpcentrum och gallerior bör begränsa antalet kunder som vistas i lokalen samtidigt. De bör också ta fram alternativa lösningar till kassaköer eller anvisa hur långt kunderna kan stå mellan varandra.
Föreningar bör om möjligt skjuta upp årsmöten och likande, eller genomföra dem digitalt.
Arbetsgivare bör se till att personal och besökare håller avstånd, att anställda arbetar hemifrån, eller kan anpassa sin arbetstid för att undvika resor i rusningstrafik, och undviker onödiga resor om det är möjligt.

"Inför alla evenemang och sammankomster med färre än 50 deltagare rekommenderar vi att arrangören gör en riskbedömning. Bedömningen bör göras enligt den modell som finns på vår webbplats. Gör den för att utvärdera och åtgärda eventuella risker. Var särskilt försiktig och uppmärksam om du arrangerar seminarier och andra evenemang som involverar hälso- och sjukvårdssektorn eller andra för samhället kritiska funktioner. Det är arrangören som ansvarar för riskbedömningen.
Digitala möten, såsom Skype-möten eller webbseminarier, bör generellt övervägas som alternativ. Vid alla evenemang bör arrangören vara extra noga med att personer med sjukdomssymtom inte deltar och att bra möjligheter till en god handhygien finns.
Vidta följande åtgärder för att minska risk för smittspridning:

Genomför en riskbedömning.
Informera om att personer som är sjuka, även de som har lätta förkylningssymtom ska stanna hemma.
Se till att det finns möjlighet att tvätta händerna med tvål och rinnande vatten. Om det inte går kan handsprit vara ett alternativ.
Informera om allmänna hygienråd genom exempelvis affischer.

Besökare ska kunna hålla avstånd till varandra.
Besökare ska äta och dricka sittandes vid bord, inte ståendes vid ståbord eller bardiskar. Personal ska helst bära ut beställningarna. Om det inte leder till trängsel eller köer är det möjligt att låta gästerna beställa och hämta sin mat och dryck själva. Hämtmat kan överlämnas som vanligt, så länge det går att göra utan trängsel mellan människor.
Den som ansvarar för verksamheten ansvarar för att ha rutiner för att göra risken för smittspridning så liten som möjligt. Det kan exempelvis innebära att verksamheten har interna riktlinjer om att personal och gäster ska ha möjlighet att tvätta händerna med tvål och rinnande vatten.

"The reported symptoms are mainly fever and cough. Other commonly reported symptoms are breathing problems, runny or blocked nose, sore throat, headache, nausea, muscle and joint pain. Most of those infected get mild symptoms that can be managed at home. Some people become severely ill with breathing difficulties and pneumonia.
The time between getting infected and developing symptoms (the incubation period) seems to be between 2 and 14 days. Most people develop symptoms after 5 days. Individual cases may deviate from this time frame.

"Since the virus is new, we have limited knowledge about which groups might run a higher risk of developing severe illness, or how much higher the risk is for them. Available data from the ongoing outbreak indicate that old age is the most prominent risk factor.
Older age combined with pre-existing medical conditions such as high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, or diabetes is also associated with developing a severe form of COVID-19.
People with asthma, allergies, or kidney disease are not identified as risk groups in the available studies. However, it is unclear to what extent these conditions have been studied and it can therefore not be excluded that they run a higher risk of severe illness. If you or your child have a condition that makes you vulnerable to infectious diseases, for example problems with the immune system, you should seek advice from your doctor about how to manage your condition and how to decrease the risks associated with COVID-19.
A Chinese study shows that only a small proportion of the identified risk groups actually develop severe illness. It is currently difficult to assess whether these findings translate to Swedish conditions. Reports from Italy indicate that people over the age of 85 are most at risk."

"Ist bei der Schließung der Kita/Schule unter Berücksichtigung des Alters der Kinder eine Betreuung erforderlich, so müssen die Eltern zunächst alle zumutbaren Anstrengungen zu unternehmen, die Kinderbetreuung anderweitig sicherzustellen (z. B. Betreuung des Kindes durch anderes Elternteil). Kann die erforderliche Kinderbetreuung auch dann nicht sichergestellt werden, dürfte in der Regel ein Leistungsverweigerungsrecht des Arbeitnehmers bestehen, da die Leistungserfüllung unzumutbar sein dürfte (§ 275 Abs. 3 BGB). D. h. in diesen Fällen wird der Arbeitnehmer von der Pflicht der Leistungserbringung frei; es ist nicht zwingend erforderlich, Urlaub zu nehmen.
Zu beachten ist jedoch, dass bei einem Leistungsverweigerungsrecht des Arbeitnehmers aus persönlichen Verhinderungsgründen nur unter engen Voraussetzungen ein Anspruch auf Fortzahlung des Arbeitsentgelts bestehen kann. Ein solcher Entgeltanspruch kann sich aus § 616 BGB für eine verhältnismäßig nicht erhebliche Zeit ergeben. Zudem kann der Anspruch aus § 616 BGB durch arbeits- oder tarifvertragliche Vereinbarungen eingeschränkt oder sogar vollständig ausgeschlossen sein.

Die Europäische Kommission hat am 24. April ein neues System für die Ausfuhren von persönlicher Schutzausrüstungen (PSA) veröffentlicht und damit die vorherigen Exporteinschränkungen gelockert: Die Liste der ausfuhrgenehmigungspflichtigen Produkte wird auf Masken, Brillen sowie Schutzkleidung reduziert und die geografische Ausnahmeregelung auch auf den Westbalkan ausgeweitet. Zudem verpflichten sich die EU-Mitgliedstaaten zur raschen Erteilung von Genehmigungen für Ausfuhren zu humanitären Zwecken. Sie finden die Regelung auf der Website der EU-Kommission.Die für deutsche Exporteure getroffene Vorgabe zum Exportverbot medizinischer Schutzausrüstung wurde vor diesem Hintergrund am 19. März aufgehoben.Auf der Website des Bundesamtes für Wirtschaft und Ausfuhrkontrolle (BAFA) finden Sie aktuelle Informationen zum Export von medizinischer Schutzausrüstung und auch die Kontaktdaten der BAFA-Hotline zum Thema.

Arbeitsplätze ohne nachgewiesene COVID-19-Erkrankung
Arbeitsplätze sollten derzeit nach Möglichkeit nicht von mehreren Mitarbeitern genutzt werden und es sind organisatorische Maßnahmen zu prüfen, um dies im betrieblichen Alltag umzusetzen. Dennoch müssen zahlreiche Arbeitsplätze gemeinschaftlich genutzt werden, z. B. bei Schichtarbeit, Rotationsnutzung, Nutzfahrzeugen, Steuerständen.
Die Oberflächen gemeinschaftlich genutzten Arbeitsplätze sind im Anschluss an eine persönliche Nutzung mit handelsüblichen Haushaltsreinigern zu reinigen. 
Dazu gehören insbesondere Oberflächen, die in Kontakt mit den Beschäftigten und möglichen Trägerstoffen, z. B. durch Tröpfchenabgabe beim Sprechen in Berührung gekommen sind (z. B. Tischplatte, Schreibtischstuhl/Armlehnen, Schrank- und Türgriffe, IT-Geräte wie Maus und Tastatur, Telefonhörer, Lenkräder, Schalthebel sowie häufig genutzte Werkzeuge und Geräte). 
Es ist zu prüfen, ob durch organisatorische Maßnahmen die gemeinschaftliche Nutzung von Arbeitsmitteln reduziert werden kann, z. B durch die personenbezogene Nutzung von IT-Eingabegeräten (Maus und Tastatur). Von einer gemeinschaftlichen Nutzung von Headsets, Schreibgeräten, wie Kugelschreiber, Bleistiften u. ä. ist generell abzusehen. 
Eine regelmäßige Reinigung der Räume ist sicherzustellen sowie verkürzte Reinigungsintervalle zu prüfen. Ungeachtet der regelmäßigen Reinigung von Oberflächen gilt für die Beschäftigten das regelmäßige Händewaschen (30 sec. mit Seife) und das Vermeiden der Berührungen des eigenen Gesichtes. 
Eine vorsorgliche Flächendesinfektion, auch von häufigen verwendeten Kontaktflächen, wird auch in der jetzigen COVID-19-Pandemie nicht als notwendig erachtet. Die angemessene Reinigung stellt das Verfahren der Wahl dar. 
SARS-CoV-2-kontaminierte Arbeitsplätze
Nach Benutzung durch einen SARS-CoV-2-positiven Beschäftigten sind deren Arbeitsplätze gesondert zu behandeln.
Generell nimmt die Infektiosität von Coronaviren auf unbelebten, trockenen Oberflächen bei Raumtemperatur bzw. höheren Temperaturen schnell ab. Auf Kupferoberflächen sind Coronaviren nur wenige Stunden, auf Karton nur unwesentlich länger und auf Kunststoff- oder Stahloberflächen wenige Tage infektiös. Bei niedrigen Temperaturen ist von einer längeren Infektiosität des Virus auszugehen.
Nach derzeitigem Kenntnisstand geht keine Infektionsgefährdung von gemeinsam genutzten Akten und Papieren aus, wenn die Kontamination mehr als 24 Stunden zurückliegt. 
Da bei einer Kontamination mit SARS-CoV-2 im unmittelbaren Umfeld eines Erkrankten eine Übertragung über Oberflächen als Schmierinfektion bei unzureichender Händehygiene nicht ausgeschlossen werden kann, ist dies bei einer anlassbezogenen Gefährdungsbeurteilung und der Festlegung von Schutzmaßnahmen zu berücksichtigen. Dabei ist auch zu entscheiden, wann eine Desinfektion von Oberflächen sinnvoll ist. Eine fachgerechte Beurteilung und Durchführung der Maßnahmen ist zwischen dem Arbeitgeber und dem beauftragten Fachbetrieb des Gebäudereiniger-Handwerks umzusetzen.
Zu berücksichtigen ist u. a.
Wie wahrscheinlich es, dass die Flächen kontaminiert wurden?Wie wurden sie kontaminiert?Wie wahrscheinlich ist eine Übertragung von diesen Flächen?Was sind es für Oberflächen (Material und Beschaffenheit, Büro, Werkstatt, Fahrzeuge)?Ist es möglich den Arbeitsplatz für mehrere Tage nicht zu nutzen?Gibt es andere Maßnahmen, zur Verhinderung der Virusverbreitung (z. B. Händehygiene, Nichtnutzung)? 
Nur bei potentieller Kontamination durch einen SARS-CoV-2-positiven Beschäftigten sollte auf der Basis der Gefährdungsbeurteilung entschieden werden, ob Desinfektionsmaßnahmen zu Verhinderung der Verbreitung von SARS-CoV-2 beitragen können. Dies kann ggf. für einen kontaminierten Arbeitsbereich sinnvoll sein. Großflächige Desinfektionen im öffentlichen Bereich sind jedoch nicht notwendig.
Wie wird desinfiziert?
Wenn eine Desinfektion von Flächen als notwendig erachtet wird, sollte diese als Wischdesinfektion durchgeführt werden. Sprühen, d. h. desinfizieren ohne mechanische Einwirkung ist weniger effektiv und aus Arbeitsschutzgründen bedenklich. Das Desinfektionsmittel muss eine Wirksamkeit gegen behüllte Viren - ""mindestens begrenzt viruzid1"" aufweisen. Die Anwendung von alkoholbasierten Produkten ist aus Brand- und Explosionsschutzgründen auf kleine Flächen beschränkt.
Konkret ist wie folgt vorzugehen:
kontaminierten Arbeitsbereich für mindestens 24 Stunden nicht betreten bzw. Arbeitsmittel nicht nutzen,Leerung von Abfallbehältern, dabei direkten Kontakt mit dem Abfall vermeiden,Desinfektion aller Oberflächen des Arbeitsplatzes, die durch Handkontakt oder Sekrete kontaminiert sein können, z. B. Tischplatte, Schreibtischstuhl/Armlehnen, Türgriffe, Maus, Tastatur, Telefonhörer, Lenkräder, Schalthebel, sowie häufig genutzte Werkzeuge und Geräte.
Hinweise für Beschäftigte des Gebäudereiniger-Handwerks im Falle einer SARS-CoV-2 Kontamination von Oberflächen
Räume sollten, wenn möglich, erst mehrere Tage nach letzter Nutzung gereinigt werden, da hierdurch von einer deutlichen Reduktion der infektiösen Viren ausgegangen werden kann. Das Reinigungspersonal ist im Rahmen der Gefährdungsbeurteilung unter Berücksichtigung der TRBA 400 zu unterweisen., Außerdem ist der sachgerechte Einsatz von Desinfektionsmitteln im Rahmen der Gefährdungsbeurteilung einzuschließen.

"Eine Infektionsübertragung durch Warenverkehr ist bislang nicht bekannt und bleibt auch bei Berücksichtigung aktueller Daten zur Stabilität von SARS-CoV-2 auf Oberflächen von Gegenständen sehr unwahrscheinlich. 
Für die Infektionskette im Warenverkehr müsste 
eine Kontamination stattgefunden haben, das Virus auf der transportierten Ware noch infektiös sein das Virus in für eine Infektion ausreichender Menge auf Schleimhäute des Beschäftigten übertragen werden. 
Derzeit wird die Tröpfcheninfektion, ausgehend von Infizierten als Hauptübertragungsweg von SARS-CoV-2 gesehen. Schmierinfektionen, z. B. durch Berührung virusbeladener Oberflächen und anschließende Übertragung des Virus auf eigene Schleimhäute sind möglich, werden jedoch beim Warenverkehr als sehr unwahrscheinlich eingestuft. Hinweise zu Infektionen durch Kontakt mit Waren gab es bei dem sehr ähnlichen SARS-Coronavirus der SARS-Epidemie 2003 nicht.

Im Warenverkehr sind die Schutzmaßnahmen bei Gefährdungen durch Biostoffe, z. B. Ungeziefer oder Schimmelbefall, einzuhalten (s.a. DGUV-Praxishilfe Frachtcontainer). Die im Rahmen der Gefährdungsbeurteilung allgemein festzulegenden Arbeitsschutzmaßnahmen sollten in der Regel ausreichend sein, um im Warenverkehr Schutz vor einer ohnehin unwahrscheinlichen SARS-CoV-2-Infektion zu bieten.

"Mund-Nasen-Schutz (MNS) oder auch Operationsmasken/OP-Masken, chirurgische Masken sind dünne Masken, die aus einer zwischen zwei Stoffschichten eingebetteten Filterschicht bestehen. Der MNS verringert in erster Linie, dass (potentiell infektiöse) Speichel-/Schleimtröpfchen des Trägers in die Umgebung gelangen. Da der MNS nicht dicht anliegt, schützt er nicht ausreichend vor einer luftgetragenen Infektion. Mund und Nase des Trägers können allerdings durch die Maske vor Berührungen durch kontaminierte Hände geschützt werden. MNS müssen die EN 14683 ""Medizinische Gesichtsmasken - Anforderungen und Prüfverfahren"" Deutsche Fassung EN 14683:2019+AC:2019 erfüllen. MNS ist kein Atemschutz!

Partikelfiltrierende Halbmasken (filtering face piece, FFP) hingegen schützen vor festen oder flüssigen Aerosole. Sie unterliegen als klassische persönliche Schutzausrüstung der Verordnung (EU) 2016/425 vom 9. März 2016 über persönliche Schutzausrüstungen. Partikelfiltrierende Halbmasken müssen die Anforderungen der EN 149 ""Atemschutzgeräte - Filtrierende Halbmasken zum Schutz gegen Partikeln - Anforderungen, Prüfung, Kennzeichnung"" Deutsche Fassung EN 149:2001+A1:2009 erfüllen. Die Norm unterscheidet je nach Rückhaltevermögen des Partikelfilters die Geräteklassen FFP1, FFP2 und FFP3. Eine dicht sitzende FFP2-Maske stellt einen geeigneten Schutz vor infektiösen Aerosolen, einschließlich Viren dar.

 Mund-Nasen-Schutz (MNS) oder auch Operationsmasken/OP-Masken, chirurgische Masken sind dünne Masken, die aus einer zwischen zwei Stoffschichten eingebetteten Filterschicht bestehen. Der MNS verringert in erster Linie, dass (potentiell infektiöse) Speichel-/Schleimtröpfchen des Trägers in die Umgebung gelangen. Da der MNS nicht dicht anliegt, schützt er nicht ausreichend vor einer luftgetragenen Infektion. Mund und Nase des Trägers können allerdings durch die Maske vor Berührungen durch kontaminierte Hände geschützt werden. MNS müssen die EN 14683 ""Medizinische Gesichtsmasken - Anforderungen und Prüfverfahren"" Deutsche Fassung EN 14683:2019+AC:2019 erfüllen. MNS ist kein Atemschutz!  Mund-Nasen-Schutz (MNS)

Sie unterliegen als klassische persönliche Schutzausrüstung der Verordnung (EU) 2016/425 vom 9. März 2016 über persönliche Schutzausrüstungen. Partikelfiltrierende Halbmasken müssen die Anforderungen der EN 149 ""Atemschutzgeräte - Filtrierende Halbmasken zum Schutz gegen Partikeln - Anforderungen, Prüfung, Kennzeichnung"" Deutsche Fassung EN 149:2001+A1:2009 erfüllen. Die Norm unterscheidet je nach Rückhaltevermögen des Partikelfilters die Geräteklassen FFP1, FFP2 und FFP3. Eine dicht sitzende FFP2-Maske stellt einen geeigneten Schutz vor infektiösen Aerosolen, einschließlich Viren dar.  Partikelfiltrierende Halbmasken filtering face piece EU

"Wirkung
Mund-Nase-Bedeckungen, Community Masken, Volksmasken, Behelfsmasken etc. können vor allem zur Minderung der Tröpfchen-Freisetzung beitragen, indem sie als Spuckschutz wirken. Durch die erzielte geringere Virenkonzentration in der Umgebungsluft eines Ausscheiders kommt es zur Unterbrechung der Infektionswege. Darüber hinaus schützen sie durch Minderung der Kontaktberührung mit Mund und Nase (Schleimhäute) vor Schmierinfektionen. 
Mund-Nase-Bedeckungen wirken daher überwiegend als Fremdschutz und nur dann wenn, sie kein Ausatemventil besitzen. Deshalb könnte das Tragen von Gesichtsschutz durch Personen, die öffentliche Räume betreten, in denen der Sicherheitsabstand nicht eingehalten werden kann und keine anderen Maßnahmen möglich sind, z. B. ÖPNV, Lebensmittelgeschäften oder auch ggf. am Arbeitsplatz, dazu beitragen, die Weiterverbreitung von SARS-CoV-2 einzudämmen. 
Die verwendeten Materialien erfüllen nicht die Anforderungen von persönlicher Schutzausrüstung. Die Mund-Nase-Bedeckungen schützen daher nicht wie partikelfiltrierende Schutzmasken gemäß DIN EN 149 und sind keine persönliche Schutzausrüstung, kein Atemschutz und kein Medizinprodukt. Bislang sollten diese Masken nur für den privaten Gebrauch genutzt werden.

Handhabung und Reinigung
Das Tragen von Mund-Nase-Bedeckungen darf zu keinem Zeitpunkt ein falsches Sicherheitsgefühl erzeugen. Auf keinen Fall dürfen Abstandsregeln vernachlässigt oder die Händehygiene nicht mehr umgesetzt werden. 
Vor dem Aufsetzten der Mund-Nase-Bedeckung die Hände gründlich mit Seife (20-30 Sekunden) reinigen. Vor dem Absetzen der Mund-Nase-Bedeckung die Hände gründlich mit Seife (20-30 Sekunden) reinigen.Nach dem Absetzen, keine Oberflächen mit den Händen berühren, Hände gründlich mit Seife (20-30 Sekunden) reinigen. 
Des Weiteren gelten folgende Regeln:
Die Maske möglichst schon vor dem Verlassen der Wohnung aufzusetzen und diese möglichst erst wieder beim Eintreffen in der eigenen Wohnung abzunehmen. Auch Mund-Nase-Bedeckungen müssen korrekt sitzen und an den Rändern enganliegend getragen werden, um das Eindringen von Luft an den Seiten zu minimieren.Bei Durchfeuchtung muss die Maske gewechselt werden. Die Maske zu keinem Zeitpunkt um den Hals tragen.Die Maske möglichst nicht mit den Händen berühren. Nach Absetzen der Maske sollten die Hände unter Einhaltung der allgemeinen Hygieneregeln gründlich 20 bis 30 Sekunden gewaschen werden. Für den Fall, dass die Maske zwischenzeitlich abgesetzt werden muss, sollte eine verpackte Ersatzmaske mitgeführt werden.Nach dem Abnehmen waschbare Mund-Nase-Bedeckungen so aufbewahren, dass sie schnell trocknen, dabei unnötige Berührung zu anderen Oberflächen vermeiden und unzugänglich für Dritte aufbewahren. Sinnvoll ist es, die Masken in einem waschbaren (gleiche Waschbedingung wie für Maske) Stoffbeutel zu geben, ohne dessen Außenseite mit der Maske zu berühren. Die Maske sollte nach dem abschließenden Gebrauch in einem Beutel verschlossen aufbewahrt oder sofort mindestens jedoch am gleichen Tag gewaschen werden, um vor allem Schimmelbildung zu vermeiden.
Eine Reinigung ist nach einmaligem Tragen vorzusehen. Die Wäsche sollte mindestens bei 60 Grad oder 75 Grad, besser jedoch bei 95 Grad (ggf. unter Verwendung von geeigneten Desinfektionsmitteln) erfolgen. Alternativ ist es möglich, die Masken für 10 Minuten im Kochtopf auszukochen. Anschließend müssen die Masken vollständig getrocknet werden.

Rechtliche Anforderungen
Mund-Nase-Bedeckungen und andere selbst hergestellte Masken sind keine persönliche Schutzausrüstung, sondern sind als Bekleidungsgegenstand einzuordnen. 
Bei Mund-Nase-Bedeckungen müssen die gewerbliche Produktion mit dem Ziel des Inverkehrbringens und die private Herstellung unterscheiden werden. Für selbstgenähten Gesichtsschutz bestehen keine normativen Anforderungen. Wenn die Masken entgeltlich oder unentgeltlich im Rahmen einer Geschäftstätigkeit auf dem Markt bereitgestellt werden, müssen sie jedoch produkt- und stoffbezogene Rechtsvorschriften erfüllen. Neben der Textilkennzeichnungsverordnung (EU) Nr. 1007/2011 und der REACH-Verordnung (EU) 1907/2006 und können aus dem Produktsicherheitsge-setz Anforderungen abgeleitet werden (z. B. Herstellerangaben). Warn- und Gebrauchshinweise (z. B. Handhabung, Pflege) und Kennzeichnungsanforderungen sind ebenso zu beachten.

Nach dem Beschluss 1/2020 des ABAS sind die Arbeiten mit SARS-CoV-2 der Schutzstufe 2 zugeordnet. Es wird bisher davon ausgegangen, dass für die meisten Arbeiten Labor- und Einmalkittel oder medizinische Berufs- und Arbeitskleidung ausreichend sind. Für Laborkittel wird keine Prüfung nach Norm gefordert.
Einige Arten von Kitteln (wenn in nicht sterilem Zustand geliefert) sind Medizinprodukte der Klasse I. Als solche können sie in Verkehr gebracht werden, ohne dass zuvor eine notifizierte Stelle eingeschaltet werden muss. Der Hersteller bescheinigt selbst, dass das Produkt die geltenden Anforderungen erfüllt. Werden solche Produkte jedoch in sterilem Zustand (z. B.

 Gesichtsvisiere, Gesichtsschutzschirme oder Face Shields sind persönliche Schutzausrüstungen, die das Gesicht und eventuell durch ihre Länge oder Erweiterungsteile den Hals vor gefährlichen Einwirkungen schützen. Face Shields Wenn bei einer Tätigkeit mit Verspritzen oder Versprühen potenziell infektiöser Materialien oder Flüssigkeiten gerechnet wird und technische Maßnahmen keinen ausreichenden Schutz darstellen, muss Augen- oder Gesichtsschutz, wie Korbbrille oder Gesichtsvisier getragen werden.  Gesichtsvisiere schützen nicht vor infektionserregerhaltigen Aerosolen. Aus diesem Grund kann das zusätzliche Tragen von Atemschutz notwendig sein.

"Die Reproduktionszahl R beschreibt, wie viele Menschen eine infizierte Person im Mittel ansteckt. Diese Zahl kann nicht alleine als Maß für Wirksamkeit von Maßnahmen herangezogen werden. Unter anderem muss die absolute Zahl der Neuinfektionen klein genug sein, um die Kapazitäten von Intensivbetten nicht zu überlasten. 
Am Anfang einer Pandemie gibt es den Startwert R0, der beschreibt, wie viele Menschen ein Infizierter/eine Infizierte im Mittel ansteckt, wenn es noch keine Immunität in der Bevölkerung gibt, noch kein Impfstoff verfügbar ist und noch keine Infektionsschutzmaßnahmen getroffen wurden. Beim neuartigen Coronavirus lag R0 zwischen 2,4 und 3,3, das heißt, jeder Infizierte hat im Mittel etwas mehr als zwei bis etwas mehr als drei Personen angesteckt. Ohne Gegenmaßnahmen wäre die Zahl der Infektionen rasch exponentiell ansteigen. Durch Infektionsschutzmaßnahmen lässt sich die Reproduktionszahl verringern. 
Es gilt:
Wenn R größer 1, dann steigende Anzahl täglicher Neuinfektionen,
Wenn R gleich 1, dann konstante Anzahl täglicher Neuinfektionen,
Wenn R kleiner 1, dann sinkende Anzahl täglicher Neuinfektionen. 
Beim neuartigen Coronavirus ist es das Ziel, die Reproduktionszahl stabil bei unter 1 zu halten. Weitere Informationen erhalten Sie beim Robert Koch-Institut."

"Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority. Most countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and many are experiencing outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and
water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and others. Why? When someone coughs, sneezes, or speaks they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets,
    including the COVID-19 virus if the person has the disease.
Avoid going to crowded places. Why? Where people come together in crowds, you are more likely to come into close contact with someone that has COIVD-19 and it is more difficult to maintain physical distance of 1 metre (3 feet).
Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and infect you.
Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately and wash your hands. Why? Droplets
    spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene, you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.
Stay home and self-isolate even with minor symptoms such as cough, headache, mild fever, until you recover. Have someone bring you supplies. If you need to leave your house, wear a mask to avoid infecting others. Why? Avoiding contact with others will
    protect them from possible COVID-19 and other viruses.
If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention, but call by telephone in advance if possible and follow the directions of your local health authority. Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information
    on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.
Keep up to date on the latest information from trusted sources, such as WHO or your local and national health authorities. Why? Local and national authorities are best placed to advise on what people in your area should be doing to protect themselves."

There is now an ongoing transmission of COVID-19 in the community in several regions in Sweden. Our advice is therefore that you work from home, if it is possible to do so and if your employer agrees. This is to decrease the speed of transmission and the number of people needing hospital care. A rapid increase of the number of infected would put unnecessary pressure on healthcare services. By slowing the rate, we give the healthcare system a better chance of coping with the extra burden.

"Available data shows that the coronavirus spreads when patients are ill with symptoms and around the time of falling ill. From what we know now, transmission does not seem to occur during the incubation period, i.e. the time between contracting the virus and developing symptoms. Those that have been exposed to COVID-19 should pay attention to any early signs of illness.
Our stance is based on the following:

There are robust scientific studies from the coronavirus that cause the disease SARS, which spread around the world in 2003. Evaluations of that outbreak show that the SARS-coronavirus does not transmit at all during the incubation period. Among all currently known viral diseases, transmission during the incubation period is very uncommon. Many viruses spread around the time that a patient develops symptoms. There is reason to believe that this applies also to this new coronavirus.
Many cases of the ongoing outbreak have been identified, but none of them have confirmed transmission during the incubation period.

Our knowledge about the new coronavirus increases every day and we monitor the development closely. Our assessments are based on the latest available credible data, and any changes to our current advice will be communicated widely. The Public Health Agency of Sweden collaborates with the WHO on these issues."

"The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) is mainly transmitted person-to-person via respiratory droplets. This means that the virus reaches the inside of your eyes, nose or mouth from droplets that are dispersed in the air when someone sneezes or coughs. The droplets fall to the ground within approximately one meter (3 ft) from the source.
There are reports of transmission of COVID-19 from people without any symptoms of illness. However, only a few studies describe the role of this type of transmission is relation to the overall spreading of COVID-19 in the community. Based on the available knowledge about COVID-19 and similar diseases, the current understanding is that this route of transmission represents a minor part.
To slow the rate of COVID-19 spreading in the community, it is important to limit the transmission of COVID-19 from those that have symptoms of illness. This is one of the objectives of the Public Health Agency’s ongoing efforts."

"The disease spreads mainly via close physical contact between people. It is not clear how long it can survive outside the body. Research on related coronaviruses shows that they can live for several days on surfaces and items, under particular conditions. Their survival depends on temperature, humidity, and sunlight. Coronaviruses are sensitive to dehydration. The amount of viruses present also determines how long a surface or item are contagious. Such studies are done under controlled conditions in laboratories, and are not directly transferable to other environments, for example in the community.
A recent study from a healthcare setting where patients with COVID-19 had been isolated shows that small amounts of genetic material from the virus can remain in the environment. Further studies will show whether living viruses also remain, and if they can spread disease.
It is important to maintain good hand hygiene. By washing your hands with soap and water you can decrease the risk of getting infected. If water and soap are not available, alcohol hand rub can be used instead.

A novel coronavirus (CoV) is a new strain of coronavirus. The disease caused by the novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China, has been named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – ‘CO’ stands for corona, ‘VI’ for virus, and ‘D’ for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as ‘2019 novel coronavirus’ or ‘2019-nCoV.’ The COVID-19 virus is a new virus linked to the same family of viruses as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and some types of common cold.

The virus is transmitted through direct contact with respiratory droplets of an infected person (generated through coughing and sneezing), and touching surfaces contaminated with the virus.

Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets, rather than through the air.

Symptoms can include fever, cough and shortness of breath. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia or breathing difficulties. More rarely, the disease can be fatal.  These symptoms are similar to the flu (influenza) or the common cold, which are a lot more common than COVID-19. This is why testing is required to confirm if someone has COVID-19. It’s important to remember that key prevention measures are the same – frequent hand washing, and respiratory hygiene (cover your cough or sneeze with a flexed elbow or tissue, then throw away the tissue into a closed bin). Also, there is a vaccine for the flu – so remember to keep yourself and your child up to date with vaccinations.

The use of a medical mask is advised if you have respiratory symptoms (coughing or sneezing) to protect others, or if you are caring for someone who may have COVID-19. If masks are worn, they must be used and disposed of properly to ensure their effectiveness and to avoid any increased risk of transmitting the virus. Disposable face masks can only be used once. The use of a mask alone is not enough to stop infections and must be combined with frequent hand washing, covering sneezes and coughs, and avoiding close contact with anyone with cold or flu-like symptoms (coughing, sneezing, fever).

What should I do if my child has symptoms of COVID-19?"	This is a new virus and we do not know enough yet about how it affects children or pregnant women. We know it is possible for people of any age to be infected and transmit the virus, although older people and/or those with pre-existing medical conditions seem more likely to develop serious illness. Children may be disproportionately affected by measures taken to control the outbreak, such as school closures and physical distancing measures. Special attention needs to be paid to prevent and minimize negative consequences for children as much as possible. Seek medical attention, but remember that it’s flu season in the Northern Hemisphere, and symptoms of COVID-19 such as cough or fever can be similar to those of the flu, or the common cold – which are a lot more frequent. Continue to follow good hand and respiratory hygiene practices like regular handwashing, and keep your child up to date with vaccinations – so that your child is protected against other viruses and bacteria causing diseases. As with other respiratory infections like the flu, seek care early if you or your child are having symptoms, and try to avoid going to public places (workplace, schools, public transport), to prevent it spreading to others.

You should seek medical care early if you or your child has a fever, cough or difficulty breathing.

If your child shows symptoms of COVID-19, seek medical care, and follow the instructions from the health care provider. Otherwise, as with other respiratory infections like the flu, keep your child well rested at home while symptomatic, and avoid going to public places, to prevent spread to others. When possible, it’s best to keep your child in class. However, it is important to follow the guidance of your local and national authorities. If national and/or local authorities have suspended classes, follow school and other official guidance on how to best ensure your children can continue with their education. It’s also important to ensure appropriate supervision for children who are out of school, to allow for continued education and also for their protection – from COVID-19, but also other potential threats they may face when left unsupervised. If your child is staying at home because of school closures, continue teaching him or her good hand and respiratory hygiene practices, like frequent handwashing, covering coughs or sneezes with a flexed elbow or tissue, then throwing away the tissue into a closed bin, not touching their eyes, mouths or noses if they haven’t properly washed their hands (click here for tips on proper handwashing), and avoiding close contact with anyone with cold/flu-like symptoms.

Anyone planning a trip should always follow local and national guidance on whether it is advisable to travel. Those traveling should check the advisory for their destination for any restrictions on entry, quarantine requirements on entry, or other relevant travel advice. Follow the same personal protection measures during travel as you would at home. In addition to taking standard travel precautions, and in order to avoid being quarantined or denied re-entry into your home country, you are also advised to check the latest COVID-19 update on the International Air Transport Association website, which includes a list of countries and restriction measures. While traveling, all parents should follow standard hygiene measures for themselves and their children: Wash hands frequently or use an alcohol-based sanitizer with at least 60 per cent alcohol, practice good respiratory hygiene (cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze and immediately dispose of the used tissue) and avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing or sneezing. In addition, it is recommended that parents always carry a hand sanitizer, pack of disposable tissues, and disinfecting wipes. Additional recommendations include: Clean your seat, armrest, touchscreen, etc. with a disinfecting wipe once inside an aircraft or other vehicle. Also use a disinfecting wipe to clean key surfaces, doorknobs, remote controls, etc at the hotel or other accommodation where you and your children are staying.

At this time, there is not enough evidence to determine whether the virus is transmitted from a mother to her baby during pregnancy, or the potential impact this may have on the baby. This is currently being investigated.

What’s the best way to talk about what’s happening?	It’s understandable if you’re feeling worried about the coronavirus. But fear and stigma make a difficult situation worse. For example, there are reports emerging from around the world of individuals, particularly of Asian descent, being subject to verbal or even physical abuse. Public health emergencies are stressful times for everyone affected. It’s important to stay informed and to be kind and supportive to each other. Words matter, and using language that perpetuates existing stereotypes can drive people away from getting tested and taking the actions they need to protect themselves and their communities. Here are some do’s and don’ts for how to talk about the coronavirus with your children, family and friends: DO: talk about the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) DON’T: attach locations or ethnicity to the disease. Remember, viruses can’t target people from specific populations, ethnicities, or racial backgrounds. DO: talk about “people who have COVID-19”, “people who are being treated for COVID-19”, “people who are recovering from COVID-19” or “people who died after contracting COVID-19” DON’T: refer to people with the disease as “COVID-19 cases” or “victims” DO: talk about people “acquiring” or “contracting” COVID-19  DON’T: talk about people “transmitting COVID-19” “infecting others” or “spreading the virus” as it implies intentional transmission and assigns blame. DO: speak accurately about the risk from COVID-19, based on scientific data and latest official health advice DON’T: repeat or share unconfirmed rumours, and avoid using hyperbolic language designed to generate fear like “plague”, “apocalypse” etc. DO: talk positively and emphasise the importance of effective prevention measures, including following our tips on handwashing. For most people this is a disease they can overcome. There are simple steps we can all take to keep ourselves, our loved ones and the most vulnerable safe.

Zum gegenwärtigen Zeitpunkt gibt es international keinen Hinweis, dass Schwangere durch das neuartige Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) gefährdeter sind als die allgemeine Bevölkerung. Es wird erwartet, dass die große Mehrheit der schwangeren Frauen nur leichte oder mittelschwere Symptome, ähnlich einer Erkältung beziehungsweise Grippe aufweist. Schwerwiegendere Symptome wie Lungenentzündung scheinen bei älteren Menschen, Menschen mit geschwächtem Immunsystem oder Langzeiterkrankungen häufiger zu sein. Wenn eine bereits vor der Schwangerschaft bestehende Herz- oder Lungenerkrankung vorliegt, könnten eher Komplikationen bei Atemwegsinfektion wie bei der Coronavirusinfektion eintreten.

Diese Empfehlung kann sich ändern, wenn sich das Wissen über das neue Virus weiterentwickelt.Wenn Sie Ihr Baby stillen möchten, werden die folgenden Vorsichtsmaßnahmen empfohlen:
Waschen Sie Ihre Hände ausreichend lang, bevor Sie Ihr Baby, die Milchpumpe oder die Flasche berühren;
tragen Sie eine Gesichtsmaske zum Füttern an der Brust;
befolgen Sie nach jedem Gebrauch die Empfehlungen zur Pumpenreinigung;
wenn Sie Ihr Baby mit Milchnahrung oder Milch füttern möchten, wird empfohlen, die Sterilisationsrichtlinien strikt einzuhalten;
wenn Sie im Krankenhaus Muttermilch abpumpen, sollte eine spezielle Pumpe verwendet werden.

"Ein selbst hergestellter, nichtmedizinischer Mund-Nasen-Schutz schützt nicht vor Ansteckung mit dem neuartigen Coronavirus. Daher wird diese Alltagsmaske auch nicht als „Schutzmaske“ bezeichnet. Allerdings kann ein nichtmedizinischer Mund-Nasen-Schutz dazu beitragen, dass Tröpfchen aus Speichel oder Rachensekreten beim Ausatmen, Sprechen, Niesen oder Husten andere Menschen weniger treffen. In jedem Fall gilt, auch wenn Sie einen nichtmedizinischen Mund-Nasen-Schutz tragen: Halten Sie den Mindestabstand von 1,5 Metern zu anderen ein, achten Sie auf eine gute Handhygiene und das Einhalten der Nies- und Husten-Etikette. Grundsätzlich gilt: Nur Atemschutzmasken mit dem FFP2- oder FFP3-Standard (""filtering face piece"") schützen den Träger vor einer Ansteckung mit Krankheitserregern. Diese Schutzmasken sind ausschließlich für medizinisches Personal und nicht für Privatpersonen vorgesehen. Bitte verzichten Sie unbedingt auf den Erwerb dieser Atemschutzmasken für private Zwecke. Eine Händedesinfektion ist im privaten Umfeld - wenn keine Infektion mit dem neuartigen Coronavirus vorliegt - im Allgemeinen nicht erforderlich. Hier ist es wichtiger, sich regelmäßig die Hände mit Seife zu waschen und darauf zu achten, dass Handtücher, Zahnbürsten, Besteck, u.ä. nicht mit anderen Familien- oder Wohnungsbewohnern geteilt wird. Bitte achten Sie auf Hygienevorschriften und die Einhaltung der korrekten Nies- und Hust-Etikette."

"Die Gefährdung für die Gesundheit der Bevölkerung in Deutschland wird derzeit insgesamt als hoch eingeschätzt.

So lautet die Einschätzung des 

Robert Koch-Instituts, der zentralen Behörde in Deutschland für Krankheitsüberwachung und -prävention. Die massiven Anstrengungen auf allen Ebenen des Öffentlichen Gesundheitsdienstes verfolgen bislang das Ziel, einzelne Infektionen in Deutschland so früh wie möglich zu erkennen und die weitere Ausbreitung des Virus dadurch so weit wie möglich zu verzögern. Ziel dieser Strategie ist es, in Deutschland Zeit zu gewinnen, um sich bestmöglich vorzubereiten und mehr über die Eigenschaften des Virus zu erfahren, Risikogruppen zu identifizieren, Schutzmaßnahmen für besonders gefährdete Gruppen vorzubereiten, Behandlungskapazitäten in Kliniken zu erhöhen, antivirale Medikamente und die Impfstoffentwicklung auszuloten. Die Anstrengungen des Gesundheitswesens müssen durch gesamtgesellschaftliche Anstrengungen ergänzt werden.

Risikogruppen ist es besonders wichtig, das Risiko einer Infektion größtmöglich zu mindern. Wichtig daher: allgemeine Verhaltensregeln (Hände waschen, Abstand halten) beachten und soziale Kontakte reduzieren. Wie groß der Anteil derjenigen ist, die aufgrund des Virus sterben, lässt sich derzeit schwer eindeutig sagen. Dazu sind noch zu viele Fragen offen. Todesfälle traten bisher vor allem bei Patienten auf, die älter waren und/oder zuvor an chronischen Grunderkrankungen litten.Vertreter der Weltgesundheitsorganisation halten eine 

Rate der Todesfälle in Chinas Regionen ohne das Epizentrum Hubei von 0,7 Prozent für möglich. Das wären sieben Verstorbene pro 1.000 Infizierte.

Erkrankte bilden Antikörper, ersten Studien zufolge vermutlich auch Patienten mit einer Covid-19-Infektion. Dafür sprechen nicht zuletzt Erfahrungen mit anderen Coronaviren. Noch ist nicht klar, wie lange diese Immunität anhält. Bei früheren Coronaviren hat sich ein Zeitraum von einigen Jahren herausgestellt. Die Arbeitshypothese des Virologen Christian Drosten von der Berliner Charité lautet deshalb: Immunität dürfte nach einer überwundenen Infektion zumindest für die Dauer der Pandemie bestehen, wahrscheinlich noch darüber hinaus. Wer einmal krank war, ist also zunächst nicht mehr gefährdet.

"Det är svårt att jämföra en helt ny sjukdom, exempelvis covid-19, med säsongsinfluensa.

De allra flesta blir lindrigt sjuka, men en liten grupp får en mycket allvarlig sjukdom och dödsfall förekommer för både säsongsinfluensa och covid-19.
Däremot kommer covid-19 drabba betydligt fler i en befolkning där den sprider sig. Den snabba och breda smittspridningen beror på att ingen i befolkningen har hunnit utveckla immunitet (ett skydd) mot denna nya virusvariant. Man kommer att se fler sjuka och fler som behöver sjukhusvård.
Säsongsinfluensan som återkommer varje år, har däremot cirkulerat i samhället under en lång tid. Därför har skyddet mot olika varianter av influensavirus kunnat byggas upp i befolkningen. Dessutom finns vaccin och läkemedel mot säsongsinfluensan

"Sjukdomen är hos de flesta en luftvägsinfektion och en rad olika symtom kan förekomma. Man kan inte baserat på bara symtomen avgöra om det är covid-19 eller annan infektion. För det krävs ett test som analyseras i laboratorium.
Bland de symtom som rapporterats är framförallt:

hosta
feber
andningsbesvär
snuva
nästäppa
halsont
huvudvärk
illamående
muskel- och ledvärk

En person som insjuknar i covid-19 kan uppvisa ett eller flera av dessa symtom. Det är ganska vanligt att man förlorar luktsinnet, och därmed smaksinnet, under en tid i samband med infektion i de övre luftvägarna. Även diarré har omnämnts.
De flesta får lindriga besvär som kan komma gradvis, och som går över av sig själva med egenvård i hemmet. En del blir allvarligt sjuka med exempelvis svårigheter att andas och lunginflammation.
Listan över symtom kan komma att justeras efterhand. Vi uppdaterar informationen om covid-19 i takt med att ny kunskap om sjukdomen tillkommer, i den vetenskapliga litteraturen och/eller från WHO.
Tiden från det att man smittats till dess man blir sjuk (inkubationstiden) bedöms vara 2–14 dagar, de flesta insjuknar efter ca 5 dagar.
Det är mycket viktigt att stanna hemma när du känner dig sjuk. Om du inte klarar dig med egenvård i hemmet ska du ringa telefonnummer 1177 för sjukvårdsrådgivning.

Se till att stanna hemma även om du får milda symtom som snuva, lätt hosta eller ont i halsen. Medicinera som vanligt för din allergi. Om symtomen inte förvärras, medicineringen hjälper och du bedömer att dina symtom sannolikt beror på allergi behöver du inte vara hemma.

"Coronaviruset (SARS-CoV-2) som orsakar sjukdomen covid-19 smittar i första hand mellan människor genom så kallad droppsmitta. Det vill säga att smitta överförs till slemhinna i ögon, näsa eller mun från droppar som sprids i luften när en sjuk person hostar eller nyser. Dropparna faller snabbt ner genom luften och når som regel inte längre än någon meter.
Viruset kan också överföras via förorenade ytor, så kallad indirekt kontaktsmitta. Man kan därför inte utesluta att smitta sker även från föremål. Det är dock ännu inte klarlagt hur länge viruset kan överleva på ytor och föremål. Material och förhållanden så som luftfuktighet, temperatur och solljus påverkar hur länge viruset överlever. Fortsatta studier får visa om spridning via ytor och föremål har någon betydelse för spridningen av covid-19.
Genom att vara noga med att hålla avstånd till andra människor i offentliga miljöer, tvätta händerna ofta med tvål och varmt vatten, hosta och nysa i armvecket, undvika att röra vid ansiktet (ögon, näsa, mun), samt att stanna hemma när man är sjuk kan alla bidra till att minska risken för smittspridning.

"Vissa grupper rapporteras ha ökad risk för allvarligare symtom vid smitta. Eftersom viruset är nytt vet vi fortfarande inte tillräckligt om vilka grupper som riskerar svår sjukdom. En genomgång av tillgängliga studier av covid-19 visar dock att hög ålder är den främsta riskfaktorn och personer över 70 år utgör därmed den främsta riskgruppen.
Personer med hög ålder i kombination med underliggande sjukdomar, såsom högt blodtryck, hjärt- kärlsjukdom, lungsjukdom, kraftig fetma och diabetes är överrepresenterade bland de svåra fallen. Extra utsatta för att drabbas av allvarlig sjukdom är personer med flera underliggande sjukdomar.
Det är möjligt att personer med sjukdom eller medicinsk behandling som påverkar immunförsvaret också har ökad risk för ett allvarligare sjukdomsförlopp. Om du har en sjukdom som generellt innebär ökad risk för allvarlig sjukdom vid luftvägsinfektioner, även om du är yngre än 70 år, bör du rådgöra med behandlande läkare kring behandling och vad du kan göra för att minska risken kopplad till sjukdomen covid-19.
Studierna visar inte att personer med astma, eller njursjukdom är riskgrupper för covid-19. Det är dock oklart i vilken utsträckning dessa grupper har studerats och därmed är det svårt att helt utesluta att personer med de här sjukdomarna inte har ökad risk.
Graviditet i sig verkar inte innebära någon ökad risk för allvarlig sjukdom vid covid-19 men en luftvägsinfektion kan vara särskilt besvärligt i slutet av graviditeten och det är då extra viktigt att försöka undvika att smittas. Risken för allvarlig sjukdom kan öka i kombination med andra riskfaktorer som t ex kraftig fetma, högt blodtryck eller diabetes.
Barn har mycket liten risk för att bli allvarligt sjuka, även de som har någon av de tillstånd eller sjukdomar som ökar risken för vuxna och äldre personer.
Ny information tillkommer kontinuerligt och Folkhälsomyndigheten bevakar utvecklingen och uppdaterar sin information enligt den senast tillgängliga kunskapen.

"Kunskapsläget om samband mellan tobaksrökning och hur svårt sjuk man blir vid covid-19 är fortfarande oklart. Tillgängliga studier visar att personer som röker eller som har rökt är överrepresenterade bland de svåra fallen av covid-19. Studierna är få och av osäker kvalitet, därför behövs mer kunskap.
Vi vet sedan tidigare att tobaksrökning ökar risken för allvarliga symtom vid luftvägsinfektioner som till exempel influensa.
Att sluta röka ger hälsovinster redan efter en kort tid. Som exempel kan nämnas ökad syresättning, lägre blodtryck och förbättrad lungfunktion. Vill du ha hjälp att sluta röka finns stöd att få till exempel hos Sluta-Röka-Linjen, 020-84 00 00.
Folkhälsomyndigheten bevakar utvecklingen och uppdaterar informationen enligt den senast tillgängliga kunskapen.

Vad kan jag göra?	"Att känna sorg när man har förlorat någon är naturligt. Sorgen pågår ofta under lång tid, men den har olika faser. I den första fasen kan känslorna vara mycket intensiva och svåra att hantera. Det är vanligt att känna t.ex. förtvivlan, ilska och skuld. I senare faser blir sorgen mindre plågsam och det brukar kännas lättare att fortsätta med sitt vardagsliv och planera inför framtiden. Under sorgen är det viktigt att du tillåter dig att känna. Försök att hålla dina rutiner när det gäller t.ex. mat och sömn. Prata gärna med  någon som du känner dig trygg med.
Om du behöver mer stöd kan du vända dig till vården. Det finns också stödlinjer du kan ringa. Läs mer om sorg, hur den kan yttra sig och hur du kan hantera den på 1177.se.

"För närvarande finns det begränsad information om covid-19 och graviditet. Det finns hittills inget som tyder på att graviditet i sig innebär en särskild risk för att bli smittad med covid-19.
Däremot kan risken för allvarlig sjukdom öka i kombination med andra riskfaktorer som t ex fetma, högt blodtryck eller diabetes. Därför bör gravida som har någon av dessa riskfaktorer vara försiktiga och rådgöra med sin barnmorska eller läkare och begränsa sina nära kontakter med människor utanför hushållet så mycket som möjligt.
Det är också viktigt att undvika att bli smittad inför förlossningen eftersom en luftvägsinfektion i slutet av graviditeten kan vara besvärlig och kan innebära risker för den gravida kvinnan. Vi rekommenderar därför att gravida kvinnor vidtar försiktighetsåtgärder mot smitta inför förlossningen.
Det finns få rapporter om barn som blivit smittade eller allvarligt sjuka under graviditet eller förlossning. Studier har hittills inte påvisat viruset i bröstmjölk.
Information finns också på Kunskapscentrum för infektioner under graviditet.

"Aktuell statistik över antalet bekräftade fall av covid-19, både i Sverige och globalt, finns på vår webbsida om Antal fall av covid-19. Antalet bekräftade och misstänkta fall förändras ständigt, allteftersom personer söker vård och undersöks för viruset.
Fram till den 12 mars 2020 gjorde man provtagningar och smittspårningar av alla misstänkta fall bland resande från riskområden till Sverige. Från och med den 13 mars 2020 prioriterar sjukvården provtagning av följande två grupper:

Personer som är i behov av vård på sjukhus.
Personal inom sjukvård och äldreomsorg med misstänkt covid-19.

Det betyder att antalet rapporterade fall är lägre från den 13 mars, och att siffrorna före och efter den förändrade provtagningsrutinen inte är jämförbara.
Denna sjukdom där många har mycket milda symtom medför en omfattande underrapportering. Det finns alltså betydligt fler fall än vad som har rapporterats. Punktinsatser görs för att undersöka hur sjukdomen är spridd i landet, till exempel testas insamlade influensaprover även för covid-19.
Just nu är målet med att samla in data, att få kunskap om hur sjukdomen sprids i landet och hur den belastar sjukvården.

"Det finns självtester för covid-19 som tillverkare marknadsför för användning i hemmiljö. Vi rekommenderar inte dessa självtester i nuläget.
Anledningen är att tillförlitligheten hos självtesterna är avsevärt lägre än hos sjukvårdens tester. Metoderna som används inom vården är nära hundraprocentiga i såväl sin exakthet som känslighet. Där används förutom provsvar också kliniska observationer, patienthistorik och epidemiologisk information för att ställa en tillförlitlig diagnos. Ett självtest kan på grund av låg känslighet, liksom om det är taget i fel fas i infektionsförloppet, visa att du inte har covid-19 trots att du i själva verket har det.
I nuläget är informationen om självtesternas exakthet och känslighet begränsad, och det finns inga publicerade fakta kring hur bra självtester fungerar för att diagnostisera covid-19-infektion.

"Coronaviruset (SARS-CoV-2) som orsakar sjukdomen covid-19 smittar i första hand mellan människor genom så kallad droppsmitta. Det betyder att smittan överförs till slemhinnorna i ögon, näsa eller mun från droppar som sprids i luften när en sjuk person hostar eller nyser. Dropparna faller snabbt ner genom luften och når som regel inte längre än någon meter.
Det finns rapporter om att personer utan symtom har smittat andra personer. Men det finns få studier som beskriver hur smittsam man är, och om detta utgör en betydande del av smittspridningen i samhället. Utifrån den erfarenhet som finns just nu, av covid-19 och andra liknande sjukdomar, är bedömningen att smittspridningen från personer utan symtom står för en mycket begränsad andel.
Detta betyder att det är viktigt att begränsa smittspridningen från de med symtom för att smittspridningen i samhället ska gå långsammare. Att uppnå detta är ett av målen med vårt arbete på Folkhälsomyndigheten.

"Det är ännu inte helt klarlagt hur länge viruset kan överleva utanför kroppen. Forskningsstudier som utförts på närbesläktade coronavirus visar att de kan överleva flera dagar på ytor och föremål men för detta krävs särskilda förhållanden. Överlevnaden påverkas exempelvis av temperatur, solljus och luftfuktighet. Coronaviruset är särskilt känsligt för uttorkning. Mängden virus påverkar också hur länge en yta eller ett föremål utgör en risk för smitta. Studierna är främst utförda i laboratorier med kontrollerad luftfuktighet och temperatur och är därför inte jämförbara med miljöer ute i samhället.
En nyligen utförd studie i vårdmiljö, där patienter med covid-19 isolerats, visar att spår av virus fanns på ytor och föremål i den miljön. Fortsatta studier får utvisa om så kallad indirekt kontaktsmitta, det vill säga spridning via droppar som landat på ytor eller föremål, har någon betydelse för spridningen av covid-19.
Det är alltid viktigt att ha god handhygien och att vara noga med att tvätta händerna med tvål och vatten. Då minskar risken för smitta. Om möjligheten till handtvätt är begränsad kan handsprit vara ett alternativ.

Om man misstänker att någon har en samhällsfarlig sjukdom (som covid-19) kan smittskyddsläkaren i regionen besluta att sätta den personen i karantän, till exempel i sin egen bostad. Karantän innebär att man inte får lämna bostaden eller ta emot besök. Besök av till exempel vårdpersonal och socialtjänst är dock tillåtet.
För personer som är sjuka kan istället isolering bli aktuellt. Beslut om karantän är alltid individuella och kan överklagas till domstol.

"Man kan med stöd av smittskyddslagen spärra av ett område på maximalt några kvarter. Avspärrningen innebär bland annat att det blir förbjudet att ta sig in och ut ur området.
En avspärrning kan till exempel bli aktuell om man upptäcker att någon eller några personer har insjuknat i en livshotande sjukdom. Då kan man använda avspärrning för att hitta smittkällan och utreda om det finns fler personer inom det avgränsade området som kan ha smittats eller spridit smittan.
Syftet med bestämmelsen är alltså att säkerställa att smittan inte tar sig ut ur området eller att någon går in och riskerar att smittas. När utredningen är klar och personerna i området är omhändertagna för vård eller har väntat ut inkubationstiden (tiden från det att en person har smittats till dess sjukdomen bryter ut), bör man häva avspärrningen.

En avspärrning kan alltså inte användas för att t.ex. hindra personer från att resa in eller ut ur ett större geografiskt område.

"Eftersom det nya coronaviruset som orsakar sjukdomen covid-19 är klassad som samhällsfarlig, kan smittskyddsläkaren i respektive sjukvårdsregion besluta om karantän för friska personer. Det kan handla om att placera personerna i hemmet, en avgränsad del av en byggnad eller ett område.
Men att sätta en person i karantän är en kraftfull åtgärd som är noga reglerad i smittskyddslagen. Om en mindre ingripande åtgärd kan få samma effekt, ska smittskyddsläkaren välja den istället. En sådan åtgärd kan t.ex. vara beslut om särskilda hygienrutiner för den smittade personen eller avstängning från arbetet, skolan eller förskolan.

"Det är viktigt att visa hänsyn och gott omdöme i mötet med andra människor, vilket innebär att vi ska hålla avstånd till andra på offentliga platser, både inomhus och utomhus. Det finns i dagsläget inga studier som visar någon exakt gräns för vilket avstånd som är säkert, men med tanke på hur droppsmittan sprids skulle ett riktmärke kunna vara minst en armlängds avstånd. En annan anledning till att Folkhälsomyndigheten endast ger ett ungefärligt mått är att verksamheter som restauranger, butiker och andra offentliga platser måste kunna ha en viss flexibilitet för att verksamheten ska fungera.
Coronaviruset överförs i första hand som kontakt- och droppsmitta från droppar som sprids i luften när någon hostar, nyser eller pratar. Studier som gjorts om infektioner som sprids genom droppsmitta visar att dropparna faller snabbt ner genom luften och når som regel inte längre än någon meter.

Du bör låta bli att åka med kollektivtrafiken, exempelvis buss, tåg, tunnelbana och spårvagn, handla i butiker eller vistas i lokaler där det finns många människor samtidigt. Ta istället hjälp av anhöriga eller grannar för att till exempel handla mat, hämta ut mediciner på apoteket eller uträtta andra ärenden.
Det är vanligt att känna oro, osäkerhet och ensamhet i en situation då man behöver hålla sig från andra människor. Det du kan göra för att det ska kännas bättre är till exempel att gå ut på promenader, men kom ihåg att hålla avstånd till andra. Håll kontakten med dina anhöriga och vänner via telefon, dator och sociala medier.
Tänk på att det här handlar om en begränsad tid. Försök att sysselsätta dig med det du tycker är roligt och stimulerande.

Vissa undervisningsmoment och examinationer som inte kan genomföras genom distansundervisning kan undantas från rekommendationen. Enskilda elever, studerande och studenter som har särskilda stödbehov ges också undantag för att kunna närvara i skolan för att få rätt resurser och förutsättningar att klara utbildningen.
Gymnasieelever och studenter är inte i behov av omsorg, till skillnad från barn i grundskolan. De högre utbildningarna samlar också elever och studenter från mycket större upptagningsområden än vad grundskolan gör.
Rekommendationen syftar till att bromsa takten i spridningen av covid-19 i samhället, och att därmed avlasta sjukvården och skydda de mest sårbara från att smittas.

"Vi på Folkhälsomyndigheten använder oss av flera olika övervakningssystem för att följa spridningen av covid-19 i Sverige. Eftersom covid-19 är anmälningspliktig enligt smittskyddslagen skickar läkare och laboratorier löpande in data till oss, som vi analyserar varje dag.
Andra sätt att samla information är att ta stickprov från patienter med influensasymtom och andra utvalda grupper i samhället. Vi kan också samla in kunskap om sökningar på 1177, sjukvårdsrådgivningens webbplats, och samtal som kommer in till 1177. Insamlade data ger underlag för beslut om åtgärder som minimerar dödlighet, sjuklighet och negativa effekter på samhället. Det gör det också möjligt att följa och utvärdera effekterna av vidtagna åtgärder samt att göra det möjligt att följa och till viss del förutsäga pandemins utveckling.
Varje vecka skickar vi på Folkhälsomyndigheten ut en veckorapport för covid-19 (fr.o.m. 2020-03-20). Dessa veckorapporter sammanfattar läget för covid-19, för veckan som har gått.

"Idrotts- och träningsaktiviteter kan fortsätta, men den som ansvarar för träningen måste se till att minska risken för att covid-19 sprids. Idrottsföreningar bör göra en riskbedömning inför olika aktiviteter och vidta försiktighetsåtgärder.
Se riskbedömningsverktyg
Träning och aktiviteter utomhus är att föredra och närkontakt mellan idrottsutövare bör undvikas.
Idrottsföreningar ska utifrån rekommendationer från Folkhälsomyndigheten och smittskyddsläkare säkerställa att de vidtar lämpliga åtgärder för att undvika smittspridning av covid-19.
Gränsen för allmänna sammankomster och offentliga tillställningar är 50 personer. Detta gäller även för idrott- och träningsaktiviteter som exempelvis matcher, träningsmatcher, tävlingar och cuper som innefattar 50 eller fler personer. Detta inkluderar såväl deltagare som publik och arrangörer.
I enlighet med de allmänna råden avråder Folkhälsomyndigheten från tävlings- och träningsmatcher för vuxna. Barn och ungdomar, födda 2002 eller senare, kan dock genomföra matcher, träningsmatcher och tävlingar under förutsättning att de utgår från den föreskrift och de rekommendationer som Folkhälsomyndigheten har tagit fram.
Du kan läsa mer i våra rekommendationer angående idrott och träningsanläggningar med anledning av covid-19.
Undvik onödiga resor i samband med idrottsutövande.
För idrottsföreningar gäller följande råd:

Undvik närkontakt mellan idrottsutövare.
Håll träningar och andra idrottsaktiviteter utomhus om det är möjligt.
Begränsa antalet åskådare och undvik trängsel.
Undvik onödiga resor i samband med träningar, tävlingar och andra idrottsaktiviteter.

Generella råd till dig som tränar:

Du som är sjuk, även med milda symtom, ska inte delta i aktiviteter. Stanna hemma tills du är helt frisk och ytterligare två dagar. Då smittar du ingen annan.
Om du insjuknar under en idrottsaktivitet ska du gå hem direkt.
Minska träningsformer som innebär en närkontakt med andra, gör andra övningar istället.
Dela inte vattenflaskor, munskydd och liknande som kan överföra saliv.
Torka av utrustning, som används av flera, efter användning. Exempelvis gymutrustning.
Tvätta händerna noga med tvål och vatten. Handsprit är ett alternativ om du inte har tillgång till vatten.
Du som är 70 år och äldre bör undvika offentliga miljöer och fysiska kontakter, och ska därför inte delta i gruppaktiviteter.

"Alla verksamheter i Sverige är skyldiga att, utifrån Folkhälsomyndighetens eller smittskyddsläkarens rekommendationer, vidta åtgärder för att minska risken för smittspridning. Detta kan till exempel innebära att begränsa antalet gäster som vistas samtidigt i en lokal. Hotell, vandrarhem och campingplatser bör också erbjuda alternativa lösningar till köer vid exempelvis incheckning, eller anvisa hur långt gästerna kan stå mellan varandra. Verksamheter bör också se till att personal och besökare har möjlighet att tvätta händerna med tvål och vatten samt erbjuda handsprit. Olikheter mellan anläggningarna, gällande till exempel storlek och läge, innebär att de kan komma att agera olika. Smittskyddsläkaren kan efter samråd med kommunen fatta beslut om att förbjuda verksamheter som inte uppfyller kraven.
Om verksamheten har restaurang, bar, café eller liknande, omfattas de av de nya reglerna för restauranger och krogar.
Det är viktigt att människor känner till och följer Folkhälsomyndighetens nya allmänna råd. Enligt de allmänna råden bör större sociala sammanhang undvikas (läs mer nedan). För besökare gäller att tänka över om vistelsen på hotell, vandrarhem eller campingplats verkligen är nödvändig. Alla behöver hjälpa till att dämpa spridningstakten av covid-19 i Sverige och avstå från onödiga resor. Hotell, vandrarhem och campingplatser kan utgöra en särskild problematik då det innebär att många från olika delar av landet samlas.

"Du som driver en restaurang, bar eller ett café måste göra det du kan för att förhindra att sjukdomen covid-19 sprids. Det innebär att du måste se till att det inte förekommer någon trängsel mellan dina gäster i köer, vid bord, bufféer eller bardiskar. Restauranggästerna ska kunna hålla ett avstånd till varandra.
Dina gäster ska sitta vid ett bord när de äter och dricker, de får inte stå vid ståbord eller bardiskar. Personalen ska helst bära ut beställningarna. Om det inte leder till trängsel eller köer är det möjligt att låta besökarna beställa och hämta sin mat och dryck själva. Hämtmat kan överlämnas som vanligt, så länge det går att göra utan trängsel.
Du som ansvarar för verksamheten måste också se till att det finns rutiner som gör risken för smittspridning så liten som möjligt. Det kan exempelvis innebära att du behöver ta fram interna riktlinjer om att personal och gäster ska ha möjlighet att tvätta händerna med tvål och rinnande vatten.

"Vi har en samhällspridning i allt fler delar av Sverige. Därför rekommenderar vi att man ska tänka igenom om resan är nödvändig att genomföra. Alla behöver hjälpa till att dämpa spridningstakten av covid-19 i Sverige.
Den som är sjuk ska inte resa alls och riskgrupper ska särskilt överväga att resa eller ta emot besök. Till riskgrupperna hör främst personer som är 70 år och äldre, och personer med en underliggande sjukdom, t.ex. hjärt- och kärlsjukdom, lungsjukdom eller diabetes.
Får vi en geografisk spridning över större delar av landet riskerar vi att hamna i ett läge där resurser inom exempelvis hälso- och sjukvården är svåra att omfördela. Det är viktigt att tänka på att man ska kunna ta hand om sig själv om man skulle insjukna på sitt resmål. Behöver man hjälp lokalt måste man vara medveten om att det kan finnas begränsat med resurser. Man bör också kunna ta sig hem själv på ett säkert sätt, utan att riskera att smitta andra, om man insjuknar på besöksorten, alternativt att man har möjlighet till isolering.
Utöver detta gäller de tidigare rekommendationerna: Skydda dig själv och andra från smittspridning

"Det är Utrikesdepartementet (UD) som avråder från resor till andra länder.
UD avråder från icke nödvändiga resor till alla länder med anledning av den omfattande spridningen av det nya coronaviruset och den snabbt föränderliga och osäkra situationen som råder för resande. I länder eller områden där UD sedan tidigare avråder från resor, gäller dessa beslut. Beslut om avrådan togs 14 mars 2020. Avrådan gäller till och med 15 juni, varefter en ny bedömning kommer att göras.
Besök UD:s webbplats för att få den senaste informationen om resor till utlandet, samt information om aktuella händelser i utlandet. Du kan även hitta information på UD:s webbplats om nya coronaviruset. Om du inte hittar svar på dina frågor där, kan du kontakta UD:s konsulära enhet på telefon 08-405 50 05, eller mejla till ud-kc-resefragor@gov.se.
En formell avrådan från att resa till ett land eller region kan göras av UD. Skälen till en sådan avrådan kan till exempel vara politiska oroligheter, våldsamheter, specifika hot men även risk för allvarlig smittspridning. Vi har tät kontakt med UD i frågor som rör smittspridning och konsekvenserna av smittspridning.
UD kan avråda från antingen icke nödvändiga resor, vilket innebär turist- och besöksresor, eller från alla resor, vilket även inkluderar arbetsresor och alla andra resor. Det finns också situationer där UD inte bara avråder från resor utan även uppmanar svenska medborgare att lämna landet.
Vi på Folkhälsomyndigheten ger inte reserekommendationer för enskilda personer eller grupper. Däremot kan vi ge UD rekommendationer, baserade på den information som vi som expertmyndighet har tillgång till i vårt internationella samarbete och via kontakterna med exempelvis WHO.
Du som resenär behöver göra en egen bedömning av ditt resande utifrån behovet av att resa och den information om smittspridningen som finns. Information finns tillgänglig på vår webbplats, men även resmålets egna myndigheter eller andra webbplatser tillhandahåller officiell information. Exempel på sådana webbplatser är WHO:s och ECDC:s webbplatser, som redovisar siffror från respektive land med någon dags eftersläpning från det att länderna officiellt rapporterar.
På International Air Transport Associations (IATA) webbplats finns reseinformation från olika länder sammanställd men kontrollera alltid med det land du planerar att resa till eller via. Om du har en nära förestående resa bör du ta kontakt med din researrangör alternativt ditt försäkringsbolag om du har frågor om av- eller ombokning.

"Den förhållandevis lilla andelen barn som rapporteras sjuka i covid-19 verkar framförallt få mycket milda symtom. Det finns i dag liten kunskap om hur stor smittspridningen är mellan barn, och det finns fortfarande inga rapporter som tyder på en mer omfattande smittspridning i barngrupper.
Även om barn har milda symtom kan de, liksom vuxna med symtom, smitta andra. Det är därför viktigt att undvika att barn som är sjuka träffar andra än familjen i samma hushåll, framförallt om de är förkylda eller har feber. Det är extra viktigt att de undviker att träffa äldre eller personer i riskgrupperna.
Kunskaper om det nya coronaviruset tillkommer varje dag och vi följer kunskapsläget noga.

"Folkhälsomyndigheten bedömer att det i nuläget inte är en betydelsefull åtgärd att stänga alla skolor i Sverige. Det finns inga vetenskapliga studier som visar att en sådan åtgärd skulle få någon större betydelse. Det finns heller inte några uppgifter som pekar på någon större spridning av covid-19 i skolor någonstans i världen.
Att stänga för- och grundskolor skulle dessutom få negativa konsekvenser för resten av samhället. Exempelvis skulle många föräldrar, som arbetar inom vården och andra samhällsviktiga funktioner, behöva stanna hemma med sina barn. Det skulle också kunna leda till att sårbara grupper, som mor- och farföräldrar, hjälper till att ta hand om barnen.
För många barn är även skolan en viktig fast punkt i tillvaron. Innan en skola stängs måste man därför ha en plan och veta vart barnen istället ska ta vägen. Det är dock av vikt att barn och skolpersonal som har begynnande symtom av sjukdom eller är sjuka stannar hemma från skolan.
Riksdagen har beslutat om en ny lag som möjliggör tillfällig stängning av skolverksamheter, lag (2020:148) om tillfällig stängning av verksamheter på skolområdet vid extraordinära händelser i fredstid. Det innebär att regeringen eller en skolas huvudman har möjlighet att under vissa förutsättningar stänga skolor. Det finns också en ny förordning (2020:115) som ger huvudmannen rätt att vidta vissa åtgärder för att säkerställa att eleverna får den utbildning de har rätt till även när skolorna är stängda.

"Så kallad droppsmitta innebär att smittan överförs från droppar som sprids i luften när någon hostar, nyser eller kräks. Dropparna faller snabbt ner genom luften och når som regel inte längre än någon meter. En del av dropparna, så kallade aerosoler, är så små att de följer med luftströmmar något längre. Både större droppar och aerosoler kan smitta den som andas in dem. Viruset som orsakar sjukdomen covid-19 sprids i första hand som kontakt- och droppsmitta och i vissa fall även som aerosol.
Så kallad luftburen smitta utgörs ofta av viruspartiklar som förökar sig i blåsor på huden och virvlar upp i luften. Luftburen smitta kan färdas långa sträckor och ses exempelvis vid mässling och vattkoppor. Även mycket små intorkade droppar kan, om de blir tillräckligt många och håller sig kvar i luften, orsaka luftburen smitta för den som andas in dem. Luftburen smitta utgör en mindre risk utomhus och på platser med god luftomsättning, där dropparna snabbt späds ut.

Coronaviruses are viruses that circulate among animals with some of them also known to infect humans. Bats are considered natural hosts of these viruses yet several other species of animals are also known to act as sources. For instance, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is transmitted to humans from camels, and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1) is transmitted to humans from civet cats. More information on coronaviruses can be found in the ECDC factsheet.

The novel coronavirus detected in China in 2019 is closely related genetically to the SARS-CoV-1 virus. SARS emerged at the end of 2002 in China, and it caused more than 8 000 cases in 33 countries over a period of eight months. Around one in ten of the people who developed SARS died. As of 30 March 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak had caused over 700 000 cases worldwide since the first case was reported in China in January 2020. Of these, more than 30 000 are known to have died.  See the situation updates for the latest available information.

How (easily) does it spread?	While animals are believed to be the original source, the virus spread is now from person to person (human-to-human transmission). There is not enough epidemiological information at this time to determine how easily this virus spreads between people, but it is currently estimated that, on average, one infected person will infect between two and three other people.  The virus seems to be transmitted mainly via small respiratory droplets through sneezing, coughing, or when people interact with each other for some time in close proximity (usually less than one metre). These droplets can then be inhaled, or they can land on surfaces that others may come into contact with, who can then get infected when they touch their nose, mouth or eyes. The virus can survive on different surfaces from several hours (copper, cardboard) up to a few days (plastic and stainless steel). However, the amount of viable virus declines over time and may not always be present in sufficient numbers to cause infection. The incubation period for COVID-19 (i.e. the time between exposure to the virus and onset of symptoms) is currently estimated to bet between one and 14 days.  We know that the virus can be transmitted when people who are infected show symptoms such as coughing. There is also some evidence suggesting that transmission can occur from a person that is infected even two days before showing symptoms; however, uncertainties remain about the effect of transmission by  non-symptomatic persons.   The infectious period may begin one to two days before symptoms appear, but people are likely most infectious during the symptomatic period, even if symptoms are mild and very non-specific. The infectious period is now estimated to last for 7-12 days in moderate cases and up to two weeks on average in severe cases. Preliminary data from the EU/EEA (from the countries with available data) show that around 20-30% of diagnosed COVID-19 cases are hospitalised and 4% have severe illness. Hospitalisation rates are higher for those aged 60 years and above, and for those with other underlying health conditions.

Reports show that clinical deterioration can occur rapidly, often during the second week of disease. Recently, anosmia – loss of the sense of smell – (and in some cases the loss of the sense of taste) have been reported as a symptom of a COVID-19 infection. There is already evidence from South Korea, China and Italy that patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection have developed anosmia/hyposmia, in some cases in the absence of any other symptoms. Elderly people above 70 years of age and those with underlying health conditions (e.g. hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease and cancer) are considered to be more at risk of developing severe symptoms. Men in these groups also appear to be at a slightly higher risk than females. Children make up a very small proportion of reported COVID-19 cases, with about 1% of all cases reported being under 10 years, and 4% aged 10-19 years. Children appear as likely to be infected as adults, but they have a much lower risk than adults of developing symptoms or severe disease. There is still some uncertainty about the extent to which asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic children transmit disease. There is limited scientific evidence on the severity of illness in pregnant women after COVID-19 infection. It seems that pregnant women appear to experience similar clinical manifestations as non-pregnant women who have progressed to COVID-19 pneumonia and to date (as of 25 March), there have been no maternal deaths, no pregnancy losses and only one stillbirth reported. No current evidence suggests that infection with COVID-19 during pregnancy has a negative effect on the foetus. At present, there is no evidence of transmission of COVID-19 from mother to baby during pregnancy and only one confirmed COVID-19 neonatal case has been reported to date. ECDC will continue to monitor the emerging scientific literature on this question, and suggests that all pregnant women follow the same general precautions for the prevention of COVID-19, including regular handwashing, avoiding individuals who are sick, and self-isolating in case of any symptoms, while consulting a healthcare provider by telephone for advice. There is no specific treatment or vaccine for this disease. Healthcare providers are mostly using a symptomatic approach, meaning they treat the symptoms rather than target the virus, and provide supportive care (e.g. oxygen therapy, fluid management) for infected persons, which can be highly effective. In severe and critically ill patients, a number of drugs are being tried to target the virus, but the use of these need to be more carefully assessed in randomised controlled trials. Several clinical trials are ongoing to assess their effectiveness but results are not yet available. As this is a new virus, no vaccine is currently available. Although work on a vaccine has already started by several research groups and pharmaceutical companies worldwide, it may be months to more than a year before a vaccine has been tested and is ready for use in humans. Current advice for testing depends on the stage of the outbreak in the country or area where you live. Testing approaches will be adapted to the situation at national and local level. National authorities may decide to test only subgroups of suspected cases based on the national capacity to test, the availability of necessary equipment for testing, the level of community transmission of COVID-19, or other criteria. As a resource conscious approach, ECDC has suggested that national authorities may consider prioritising testing in the following groups: hospitalised patients with severe respiratory infections;
symptomatic healthcare staff including those with mild symptoms;
cases with acute respiratory infections in hospital or long-term care facilities;
patients with acute respiratory infections or influenza-like illness in certain outpatient clinics or hospitals;
elderly people with underlying chronic medical conditions such as lung disease, cancer, heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, renal disease, liver disease, diabetes, and immunocompromising conditions."

"Current advice for testing depends on the stage of the outbreak in the country or area where you live. Testing approaches will be adapted to the situation at national and local level. National authorities may decide to test only subgroups of suspected cases based on the national capacity to test, the availability of necessary equipment for testing, the level of community transmission of COVID-19, or other criteria. As a resource conscious approach, ECDC has suggested that national authorities may consider prioritising testing in the following groups: hospitalised patients with severe respiratory infections;
symptomatic healthcare staff including those with mild symptoms;
cases with acute respiratory infections in hospital or long-term care facilities;
patients with acute respiratory infections or influenza-like illness in certain outpatient clinics or hospitals;
elderly people with underlying chronic medical conditions such as lung disease, cancer, heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, renal disease, liver disease, diabetes, and immunocompromising conditions."

If you are feeling ill with COVID-19 symptoms (such as fever, cough, difficulty breathing, muscle pain or general weakness), it is recommended that you contact your local healthcare services online or by telephone. If your healthcare provider believes there is a need for a laboratory test for the virus that causes COVID-19, he/she will inform you of the procedure to follow and advise where and how the test can be performed. A large proportion of the population (up to 15-20%) reports seasonal symptoms related to pollen, the most common of which include itchy eyes, nasal congestion, runny nose and sometimes wheezing and skin rash. All these symptoms are usually referred to as hay fever, pollen allergy or more appropriately allergic rhinitis. Allergic rhinitis is commonly associated with allergic asthma in children and adults. Allergies, including mild allergic asthma, have not been identified as a major risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection or for a more unfavourable outcome in the studies available so far. Moderate to severe asthma on the other hand, where patients need treatment daily, is included in the chronic lung conditions that predispose to severe disease. Children and adults on maintenance medication for allergies (e.g. leukotriene inhibitors, inhaled corticosteroids and/or bronchodilators) need to continue their treatment as prescribed by their doctor and should not discontinue their medication due to fears of COVID-19. If they develop symptoms compatible with COVID-19, they will need to self-isolate, inform their doctor and monitor their health as everyone else. If progressive difficulty breathing develops, they should seek prompt medical assistance. Someone with COVID-19 usually has mild, flu-like symptoms (see above question 1), which are rather common and need to be distinguished from similar symptoms caused by common cold viruses and from allergic symptoms during springtime. The following table presents a comparison of the most common symptoms of all three conditions according to their reported frequency. It is good to bear in mind that the definitive diagnosis of COVID-19 is not clinical, but through laboratory testing of a sample from the nose or mouth.

 If you feel unwell, stay at home. If you develop any symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, you should immediately call your healthcare provider for advice. Physical distancing aims to reduce physical contact between potentially infected people and healthy people, or between population groups with high rates of transmission and others with low or no level of transmission. The objective of this is to decrease or interrupt the spread of COVID-19. Note that the term ‘physical distancing’ means the same thing as the widely used term ‘social distancing’, but it more accurately describes what is intended, namely that people keep physically apart. Physical distancing measures might be implemented over an extended period and their success depends on ensuring that people maintain social contact – from a distance – with friends, family and colleagues. Internet-based communications and the phone are therefore key tools for ensuring a successful physical distancing strategy. On a personal level, you can perform physical distancing measures by: Voluntarily self-isolating if you know you have the virus that causes COVID-19, or if you have suggestive respiratory symptoms, or if you belong to a high-risk group (i.e. you are aged 70 years or more, or you have an underlying health condition).
 Many countries in the EU/EEA and the UK have installed quarantine and social/physical distancing as measures to prevent the further spread of the virus. These measures can include: The full or partial closure of educational institutions and workplaces;
Limiting the number of visitors and limiting the contact between the residents of confined settings, such as long-term care facilities and prisons;
Cancellation, prohibition and restriction of mass gatherings and smaller meetings;
Mandatory quarantine of buildings or residential areas;

The COVID-19 pandemic is posing an unprecedented threat to the EU/EEA countries and the UK, which have been experiencing widespread transmission of the virus in the community for several weeks. In addition, there has been an increasing number of reports of COVID-19 outbreaks in long-term care homes across Europe with high associated mortality, highlighting the extreme vulnerability of the elderly in this setting. The absence of an effective treatment or a vaccine combined with an exponential growth in infections from late February led many countries to implement non-pharmaceutical interventions such as “stay-at-home” policies (recommended or enforced), jointly with other community and physical distancing measures such as the cancellation of mass gatherings, closure of educational institutions and public spaces. The outbreak of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK has evolved dramatically, and many countries have moved to a scenario of sustained community transmission with large numbers of cases infected. The rapid escalation of cases in countries such as Italy and Spain has placed an enormous pressure on the healthcare system and this has been a major challenge for local services. All countries in the EU have responded to the emerging situation through implementation of a comprehensive package of measures including surveillance, testing, case management and strategies to mitigate the impact of the pandemic such as physical distancing measures.[ The outbreak of COVID-19 has evolved dramatically in the EU/EEA and the UK.

The stay-at-home and physical distancing measures that have been imposed throughout the EU/EEA and the UK are highly disruptive to society, both economically and socially, and there is very wide agreement that they should be lifted as soon as it is safe to do so. However, lifting the measures too early or too quickly carries the risk of a rapid return to high infection rates, and this could overwhelm the health system while causing high levels of illness and many deaths. The Joint European Roadmap towards lifting COVID-19 containment measures addresses this issue by providing the framework for an economic and social recovery plan for the EU alongside a set of public health principles that are aimed at minimising the risk of a resurgence in the number of cases. Should a resurgence occur, the stay-at-home and physical distancing measures may need to be put in place again. It is increasingly recognised that we will be living with COVID-19 for many months, or even years. This disease will continue to affect our lives for some time to come, and we all need to prepare mentally for that.  This outbreak is evolving rapidly.

When will we see the peak?	As greater evidence emerges regarding the nature of the virus and the effectiveness of measures used to control the outbreak, predictions relating to the future course of COVID-19 will become more reliable.  The evidence we have to date indicates that COVID-19 does not cause serious illness in children – not nearly as much as it does for adults. However, they can still be infected, though the extent to which children play a role in the transmission of the virus to others is still uncertain. Therefore, as one of several measures to limit the possible spread of the virus, most EU/EEA countries and the UK have closed some or all schools and day care centres. However, school closures may have an impact on availability of healthcare staff and other essential services, due to the need for having to care for their children when not in school, which needs to be taken into consideration (e.g. some countries only maintain schooling for these children of staff in a critical role). Also, if grandparents are asked to care for the children, the benefits of lower transmission between children might be offset by transmission into a more vulnerable population group. Following a reduction in the virus transmission, several countries (e.g., Austria, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Norway, Slovenia) have now started to ease some of the measures they have had in place, including by re-opening primary schools and day care centres. If the virus starts to spread again once these measures are lifted, it is possible that schools may have to be closed again for a period of time. Each EU/EEA country and the UK have dedicated websites with information for the public on COVID-19 and on the national situation. Consult with your national authorities to get advice tailored for your setting.

However, school closures may have an impact on availability of healthcare staff and other essential services, due to the need for having to care for their children when not in school, which needs to be taken into consideration (e.g. some countries only maintain schooling for these children of staff in a critical role). Also, if grandparents are asked to care for the children, the benefits of lower transmission between children might be offset by transmission into a more vulnerable population group. Following a reduction in the virus transmission, several countries (e.g., Austria, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Norway, Slovenia) have now started to ease some of the measures they have had in place, including by re-opening primary schools and day care centres. If the virus starts to spread again once these measures are lifted, it is possible that schools may have to be closed again for a period of time. Each EU/EEA country and the UK have dedicated websites with information for the public on COVID-19 and on the national situation. Consult with your national authorities to get advice tailored for your setting.

Travel has been shown to facilitate the spread of COVID-19 from affected to unaffected areas. Travel and trade restrictions during a public health event of international concern (PHEIC) are regulated under the International Health Regulations (IHR), part III. On 16 March, in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus, the European Union leaders agreed to a temporary restriction on non-essential travel from third countries into the EU area by closing its borders for the next 30 days staring on 17 March 2020 The temporary travel restriction foresees exemptions for nationals of all EU Member States and Schengen Associated States (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland; whilst UK nationals are still to be treated in the same way as EU citizens until end 2020), for the purposes of returning to their homes. Exceptions are also foreseen for travellers with an essential function or need. In addition, most EU countries have also applied national borders closure and/or border checks and travel and transport restrictions or bans within their national borders and between different regions as a measure to slow the spread. See the measures implemented by EU Member States. Mobility measures implemented or announced by Member States Many EU countries have also encouraged their citizens to return home (with recommendations  for 14 days self-quarantine upon return) but also recommended that travellers avoid non-essential travels to areas with transmission of COVID-19. Travellers should adhere to strict hygiene measures, wash hands with soap and water regularly, and/or use alcohol-based hand sanitisers. Touching the face with unwashed hands should be avoided. Travellers should avoid contact with sick persons, in particular those with respiratory symptoms and fever. It should be emphasised that older people and those with underlying health conditions should take these precautionary measures very seriously. Travellers who develop any symptoms during or after travel should self-isolate; those developing acute respiratory symptoms within 14 days upon return should be advised to seek immediate medical advice, ideally by phone first to their national healthcare provider. The risk of being infected on an airplane cannot be excluded, but is currently considered to be low for an individual traveller. The risk of being infected in an airport is similar to that of any other place where many people gather. If it is established that a COVID-19 case has been on an airplane, other passengers who were at risk (as defined by how near they were seated to the infected passenger) will be contacted by public health authorities. Should you have questions about a flight you have taken, please contact your local health authority for advice.  The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) recommended measures to be taken by national authorities, such as thorough disinfecting and cleaning of aircraft after each flight serving high-risk destinations. EASA also recommended that airlines operating on all routes step up the frequency of cleaning, disinfect as a preventative measure and ensure full disinfection of any aircraft which has carried a passenger who was suspected or confirmed as being infected with COVID-19. Airport operators should similarly disinfect terminals regularly. There is evidence that checking people at the airport by reading their skin temperature (known as entry screening) is not very effective in preventing the spread of the virus, especially when people do not have symptoms. It is generally considered more useful to provide those arriving at airports with clear information explaining what to do if they develop symptoms after arrival.

Exercising poses a potential risk from SARS-CoV-2 infection to athletes and coaches. This is particularly an issue in settings where athletes train in groups, engage in contact sports, share equipment or use common areas, including locker rooms. Community and individual-level recreational sport activities could also potentially heighten the risk of spreading coronavirus. Transmission could occur through person-to-person contact, exposure to a common source, or aerosols/droplets from an infected individual. Nevertheless, in light of the benefits of regular physical activity to physical and mental health it is important to remain active during the COVID-19 pandemic while respecting physical distancing and personal hygiene recommendations.

A recent study published by The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) reported that the causal agent of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) is able to persist for up to 24 hours on cardboard, in experimental settings (e.g. controlled relative humidity and temperature). In practice however there is no evidence of the infection ever being transmitted through contaminated packages that are exposed to different environmental conditions and temperatures. People working in the supply chain, including logistics, control services, retail, etc. are not at greater risk to of getting COVID-19 as a result of managing packages. ECDC does not recommend any special measures at the supply chain over and above those addressed to the general public: frequent and thorough hand washing and use of alcohol-based hand disinfectants, keeping a distance from other employees, and not working if showing signs of respiratory symptoms.

So zählen etwa Vollzeit arbeitende Beschäftigte mit dem Faktor 1. Da Ausbildung uns ein wichtiges Anliegen ist, gilt hier Folgendes: Das Unternehmen kann wählen, ob es die Auszubildenden bei der Beschäftigtenzahl mitzählt oder nicht. Wenn ein Unternehmen z. B. 5 Beschäftigte und einen Auszubildenden hat, kann dieser mitgezählt werden, damit das Unternehmen den höheren Soforthilfebetrag bekommt. Wenn ein Unternehmen ohne Auszubildende bereits 10 Beschäftigte (Vollzeitäquivalente) hat, dann müssen die Auszubildenden nicht mitgezählt werden, damit das Unternehmen den Zuschuss noch bekommt. Zu weiteren Einzelfragen im Hinblick auf die Beschäftigtenzahl haben die Bundesländer jeweils spezifische Informationen veröffentlicht."

Es gibt das einheitliche Bundesprogramm „Corona-Soforthilfe für Kleinstunternehmen und Soloselbständige“, für das die Länder die Antragsbewilligung und Auszahlung übernommen haben. Mit diesem Soforthilfeprogramm deckt der Bund bereits rund 90 % der etwa 3 Millionen kleinen Unternehmen und Soloselbständigen ab. Zusätzlich haben zahlreichen Bundesländer eigene Soforthilfeprogramme aufgelegt. Die Länder haben die Möglichkeit, besondere regionale Probleme oder höheren Bedarf, der beispielsweise auf Grund von höheren Gewerbemieten in Großstädten entstehen kann, durch eigene Hilfsprogramme aufzufangen. Eine Kombination des Soforthilfeprogramms des Bundes mit anderen öffentlichen Hilfen, beispielsweise mit einem Landesprogramm, ist zulässig, soweit dadurch keine Überkompensation eintritt. Beispielsweise kann ein Antragsteller, der bereits Soforthilfe aus einem Landesprogramm erhalten hat, noch zusätzlich Soforthilfe aus dem Bundesprogramm bis zur Höchstgrenze des Zuschusses erhalten, wenn er die Voraussetzungen für die Soforthilfe nach dem Bundesprogramm erfüllt und der Förderhöchstbetrag nicht erreicht wurde."

"(Stand: 20. März 2020)
Der Corona-Effekt auf die international stark verflochtene deutsche Wirtschaft äußert sich in diversen Schocks, die anders als bei der Finanzkrise sowohl die Angebots- als auch die Nachfrageseite betreffen: Zum einen leiden die deutschen Exporte unter einem Nachfrageshock, da der Konsum in China und anderen betroffenen Ländern einbricht und deutsche Exporte weniger stark nachgefragt werden.
Dann sind die Vorleistungen von einem Angebotsschock betroffen, da wegen des Stillstands bei chinesischen Zulieferern direkt und indirekt Störungen in den grenzüberschreitenden Wertschöpfungsketten entstehen. Hinzu kommen Produktionsbehinderungen, die aus der zeitweise Krankheits- oder Quarantänebedingte Arbeitsunfähigkeit der Arbeitnehmer erwachsen.
Außerdem ist die heimische Nachfrage im Tourismussektor, im Reise-, Messen- und Gaststättengewerbe auf Grund der Infektionsgefahr eingebrochen. Die jüngst ergriffenen Maßnahmen wie etwa Schulschließungen, die Schließung von Grenzen sowie von Gaststätten, Diskotheken und Freizeiteinrichtungen wirken ähnlich. Insgesamt wird sich die Anpassung der Konsumgewohnheiten an die neue Situation vorübergehend dämpfend auf die Konjunktur auswirken.
Die Bundesregierung ist dabei, umfangreiche Maßnahmen auf den Weg zu bringen, um den negativen wirtschaftlichen Auswirkungen entgegen zu wirken.
Auch der Einzelhandel mit für die Bevölkerung systemrelevanten Waren (Lebensmittel und Drogerieartikel) steht vor großen Herausforderungen. Der Handel tut alles in seiner Möglichkeit Stehende, um die Verfügbarkeit der notwendigen Waren in den Verkaufsräumen sicherzustellen. Die Lager sind voll. Aktuell besteht die Herausforderung darin, ausreichend Verkaufspersonal und Lagermitarbeiter zu haben, insbesondere wenn der Krankenstand ansteigen sollte."

"(Stand: 20. März 2020)
Derzeit sind die Auswirkungen auf die deutsche Wirtschaft sehr schwer abzuschätzen. Eine Reihe von Wirtschaftsforschungsinstituten haben mittlerweile jedoch Aktualisierungen ihrer Wirtschaftsprognosen veröffentlicht: Für Deutschland erwartet das IfW Kiel in seiner jüngsten Prognose ein negatives Wachstum von -0,1 Prozent für 2020, ebenso wie das DIW Berlin. Das ifo Institut geht mit -1,5 Prozent vom stärksten Rückgang aus, gleich dahinter reiht sich das rwi Essen mit -0,8 Prozent ein. Das IWH Halle erwartet seinerseits in seinem Basisszenario immerhin noch ein Wachstum von 0,6 Prozent. Diese Einschätzungen sind vermutlich bereits überholt, verdeutlichen aber die Bandbreite des Prognosespektrums und die erhöhte Unsicherheit bezüglich Einschätzungen zu den tatsächlichen ökonomischen Auswirkungen des Coronavirus. Die Bundesregierung stellt ihre Frühjahrsprojektion Ende April vor – bis dahin liegen weitere Informationen vor.
Nach den Beschlüssen der Bundesregierung zu Reise- und Veranstaltungsbeschränkungen und Geschäftsschließungen zur Bekämpfung der weiteren Ausbreitung des Coronavirus sowie Meldungen zu Produktionsstopps in der Industrie haben sich die wirtschaftlichen Aussichten weiter verschlechtert. Die am 17. März veröffentlichten ZEW-Konjunkturerwartungen von Finanzmarktexperten zeigen einen historisch tiefen Einbruch. Der erstmals in seiner 70-jährigen Geschichte vorzeitig veröffentlichte ifo Index zeigte am 19. März ebenfalls einen historischen Rückgang an.

In Absprache mit der Europäischen Kommission haben die europäischen Normungsorganisationen CEN und CENELEC beschlossen, den Kampf gegen das Corona-Virus zu unterstützen. Mit dem Einverständnis aller Mitglieder – darunter auch dem Deutschen Institut für Normung e.V. DIN – stellen die Organisationen bis auf Weiteres eine Reihe von Europäischen Normen für Medizinprodukte und persönliche Schutzausrüstung kostenlos zur Verfügung. Das soll die Bekämpfung der COVID-19-Pandemie unterstützen. Auch zahlreiche internationale Standards im Bereich der Anästhesie, für Beatmung, aber auch Risikomanagement und Resilienz sind dort derzeit frei verfügbar. 
Die Normen richten sich rein an professionelle Anwender. Interessierte Unternehmen und Organisationen können sie im Webshop des Beuth Verlags unter www.beuth.de/go/kostenlose-normen herunterladen. Darüber hinaus können Anwender über eine DIN-Plattform Fragen an die Experten der Normenausschüsse zu Normungsinhalten richten oder sich in kostenlosen Webinars zur Produktionsumstellung auf Schutzmasken informieren. Weitere Informationen sowie die komplette Liste aller kostenlosen Normen finden Sie auf der Internetseite des Deutschen Instituts für Normung e.V. DIN.
Das Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie begrüßt die Initiativen, die für viele Unternehmen ein Anstoß sein können, ihre Geschäftsmodelle und Produktlinien umzustellen. So können kurzfristig in der Krise sichere und qualitativ hochwertige Schutzausrüstung und Medizinprodukte hergestellt und damit auch Arbeitsplätze erhalten werden. Dabei sind Normen ausgesprochen wichtig, um die Sicherheit von Produkten zu gewährleisten und den herstellenden Betrieben eine Handreichung für ihre Herstellung geben zu können. Gerade auch kleinen und mittleren Betrieben kann so geholfen werden, in der Krise schneller reagieren und ihre Produktion wie auch Prozesse erfolgreich anpassen zu können."

März 2020)
In den vergangenen Tagen haben das Bundeswirtschaftsministerium vermehrt Anfragen zu verschiedenen energiewirtschaftlichen Themen im Zusammenhang mit COVID-19 erreicht. Es geht dabei unter anderem um die Frage, was passiert, wenn ein geplantes und bereits bezuschlagtes EEG-Projekt wegen COVID-19 nicht innerhalb der vorgegebenen Realisierungsfrist errichtet werden kann, etwa wegen Lieferengpässen bei Material oder fehlenden Fachkräften. Hier hat das BMWi gemeinsam mit der Bundesnetzagentur (BNetzA) eine unbürokratische Lösung gefunden. So wird zum Beispiel bei Windenergieanlagen an Land und Biomasseanlagen eine Verlängerung der Realisierungsfrist auf formlosen Antrag von der BNetzA gewährt. Die Anträge können per E-Mail gestellt werden, in ihnen sind die Gründe mitzuteilen, die zu einer Verzögerung des Projekts geführt haben. Auch Pönalen sollen hier nicht erhoben werden. Details können Sie dem beigefügten Überblick der BNetzA (PDF, 420 KB) entnehmen.
Ein weiteres Thema ist die Beantragung der Besonderen Ausgleichsregelung (BesAR) für die EEG-Umlage. Wollen Unternehmen im Jahr 2021 die BesAR, also eine Ermäßigung der EEG-Umlage in Anspruch nehmen, müssen sie dies bis zum 30.6.2020 beantragen. Es handelt sich hier um eine materielle Ausschlussfrist. Wird die Frist verpasst, kann die EEG-Umlage nicht ermäßigt werden. An das BMWi wurden Bedenken herangetragen, dass Unternehmen aufgrund von COVID-19 möglicherweise die Antragsfrist verpassen könnten.

"(Stand: 23. März 2020)
Das Bundesamt für Sicherheit weist aktuell darauf hin, dass mit der Corona-Pandemie Auswirkungen auf die IT-Sicherheit zu erwarten sind, denn auch Cyberkriminelle nutzen jetzt verstärkt die Gelegenheit, mit Hilfe der derzeitigen Pandemie, ihre Schadsoftware in Form von Fake-News, Spam-Mails mit betrügerischen Anhängen oder virenbehafteten Links in gezielte Angriffe umzusetzen, um Netzwerkinfrastrukturen erheblich zu schädigen. Damit wird es mithilfe des Coronavirus möglich, die individuelle Emotionslage von einzelnen Nutzerinnen und Nutzer für kriminelle Vorgehensweisen im Cyberbereich auszunutzen.
Eine Pandemie zeigt damit erstmals Auswirkungen auch auf die IT-Sicherheit. Falschmeldungen, die vorwiegend durch soziale Netzwerke veröffentlicht werden, verbreiten sich zudem in den letzten Tagen massiv. Das einzige Ziel dieser Falschmeldungen ist es jedoch, Panik zu verbreiten und entsprechend Nutzerinnen und Nutzer bewusst mit Falschinformationen zu versorgen und Ängste zu schüren.
Was Unternehmen jetzt beachten müssen, steht hier."

"(Stand: 30. März 2020)
Übernimmt der Bund aktuell weiterhin Exportkreditgarantien (sogenannte Hermesdeckungen) für Exporte in Coronavirus-Risikogebiete?

Ja. Ansprechpartner für konkrete Fragen zu Deckungsmöglichkeiten sind die Mandatare des Bundes von der Euler Hermes AG.Was bedeutet das Maßnahmenpaket der Bundesregierung für die Exportkreditgarantien des Bundes? 
Das am 13. März 2020 von den beiden Bundesministern Scholz und Altmaier vorgestellte Maßnahmenpaket ist ein umfassendes Hilfsprogramm und soll dazu beitragen, Beschäftigte und Unternehmen vor den negativen wirtschaftlichen Auswirkungen des Corona-Virus zu schützen. Das Maßnahmenpaket umfasst eine Reihe von Finanzierungs- und Absicherungsinstrumenten, einschließlich der Exportkreditgarantien des Bundes. Sie stehen in der aktuellen Krise auch weiterhin zur Absicherung von Exportgeschäften und -finanzierungen zur Verfügung. Die Exportkreditgarantien, die Exporteure und Banken gegen wirtschaftlich und politisch bedingte Forderungsausfälle absichern, werden auf Grundlage einer umfangreichen haushaltsrechtlichen Ermächtigung übernommen. Für den Fall, dass ein zusätzlicher Bedarf an Exportdeckungen besteht, kann der Bund die Ermächtigung sehr schnell ausweiten. Somit stehen auch im Bereich der Exportkreditgarantien des Bundes ausreichend Mittel zur Verfügung, um Exporteure und Banken in dieser schwierigen Zeit wirkungsvoll zu schützen.

Können auch Exporte in die EU und in OECD-Staaten mit Exportkreditgarantien abgesichert werden?

Ja, ab sofort können Exportgeschäfte zu kurzfristigen Zahlungsbedingungen (bis 24 Monate) auch innerhalb der EU und in bestimmten OECD-Ländern mit staatlichen Exportkreditgarantien des Bundes abgesichert werden. Damit können insbesondere mögliche Engpässe im privaten Exportkreditversicherungsmarkt aufgefangen werden.

Begünstigte Länder sind neben der EU auch Australien, Island, Japan, Kanada, Neuseeland, Norwegen, Schweiz, USA und das Vereinigte Königreich. Die erweiterten Deckungsmöglichkeiten sind zunächst bis zum 31. Dezember 2020 befristet.

Ermöglicht wird dies durch einen Beschluss der Europäischen Kommission vom 27.03.2020, die Bestimmungen der sogenannten Kurzfristmitteilung zu ändern. Damit wird die Liste der marktfähigen Risiken, also der Länder, für die normalerweise keine Absicherung durch staatliche Exportkreditgarantien zulässig ist, vorübergehend gestrichen. Die Kommission hat damit schnell und flexibel auf die Bitten mehrerer Mitgliedstaaten, darunter auch Deutschland, reagiert. Sie hat den Mitgliedstaaten die Möglichkeit eröffnet, zeitnah und entschlossen zu reagieren, sollten sich private Exportkreditversicherer als Reaktion auf die Corona-Pandemie zurückziehen.

Einzelheiten zu den erweiterten Deckungsmöglichkeiten für das Kurzfristgeschäft finden sich auf den Internetseiten des Mandatars des Bundes.Wie können mir Exportkreditgarantien in der jetzigen Zeit überhaupt helfen? 
Die Exportkreditgarantien des Bundes sind für exportorientierte Unternehmen ein wichtiges Element der Risikosteuerung. Aktuell haben sie für Exporteure jedoch eine noch größere Bedeutung, weil auch langjährige und solvente Kunden in Zeiten der Corona-Krise plötzlich und unverschuldet in Zahlungsschwierigkeiten geraten können. Der Bund bietet Ihnen mit seinen Exportkreditgarantien einen weitreichenden Schutz. Das Risiko eines Zahlungsausfalls geht zu einem großen Teil auf den Bund über. In der Praxis bedeutet das grundsätzlich: Ist der jeweilige Kunde weiterhin zur Zahlung verpflichtet und kann nicht zahlen, springt der Bund ein. Ob ein Auslandskunde trotz der Corona-Krise noch zur Zahlung verpflichtet ist, hängt maßgeblich von den exportvertraglichen Vereinbarungen ab. Kann der Kunde aufgrund einer in den Exportvertrag aufgenommenen Force Majeure-Klausel zum Beispiel kündigen, wird er auch nicht mehr zur Zahlung verpflichtet sein.
Daher ist zu empfehlen, Exportverträge zu überprüfen:
Wie sind die Risiken beim Eintritt unvorhergesehener Ereignisse während der Vertragserfüllung verteilt?Bestehen Kündigungsrechte?Trägt das Unternehmen das Beschaffungsrisiko, wenn Unterlieferanten infolge unvorhergesehener Umstände die Zulieferungen nicht rechtzeitig vornehmen können? Oder hat das Unternehmen selbst das Recht zur Vertragskündigung, um die Ziehung von Vertragsgarantien zu verhindern?

Gegen das Risiko, dass trotz einer eigenen Kündigung die Vertragsgarantien gezogen werden, kann eine Vertragsgarantiedeckung beim Bund absichern.
Gibt es Auswirkungen auf bestehende Deckungen für Lieferungen und Leistungen in Coronavirus-Risikogebiete?
Das Coronavirus führt nicht dazu, dass ein bestehender Deckungsschutz entfällt oder eingeschränkt wird. Eine Entschädigungsfähigkeit unter einer Hermesdeckung hängt unter anderem von dem Deckungsprodukt und der Einhaltung der Entschädigungsvoraussetzungen ab. 
Wann und in welchem Umfang sind Schäden aufgrund des Coronavirus unter den Hermesdeckungen abgesichert?
Schäden können sowohl in der Herstellungsphase entstehen als auch den Ausfall einer Forderung nach Lieferung umfassen. Für beide Konstellationen bietet der Bund Deckungsschutz an: eine Fabrikationsrisikodeckung für Schäden in der Herstellungsphase und eine Lieferantenkreditdeckung für einen möglichen Forderungsausfall (Forderungsdeckung).
Was ist unter einer Fabrikationsrisikodeckung versichert?
Die Fabrikationsrisikodeckung bietet primär Schutz vor den finanziellen Folgen eines Produktionsabbruchs. Ist es infolge eines von der Fabrikationsrisikodeckung abgesicherten Risikos unmöglich oder zumindest unzumutbar, die Fertigung fortzusetzen beziehungsweise gefertigte Waren zu versenden, sind die entstandenen Selbstkosten grundsätzlich entschädigungsfähig. Das kann zum Beispiel der Fall sein, wenn wegen Auswirkungen des Coronavirus nicht mehr damit gerechnet werden kann, dass sich der Auslandskunde weiterhin vertragstreu verhalten wird. Bei einer bestehenden Fabrikationsrisikodeckung ist es wichtig, den Mandataren des Bundes von der Euler Hermes AG erforderlich werdende Liefer- und Leistungszeitverschiebungen umgehend mitzueilen. Verschiebungen bedürfen der Zustimmung des Bundes.
Was ist unter einer Forderungsdeckung versichert?
Die Forderungsdeckung bietet Schutz davor, dass ein Auslandskunde eine Forderung nicht bezahlt, obwohl er dazu verpflichtet ist. Voraussetzung hierfür ist aber, dass die Forderung auch tatsächlich besteht: Schäden aufgrund des Coronavirus können eventuell einen Fall höherer Gewalt darstellen und damit die Forderung entfallen lassen. 
Bei einer bestehenden Forderungsdeckung müssen den Mandataren des Bundes von der Euler Hermes AG Liefer- sowie Leistungszeitverschiebungen und selbstverständlich auch Zahlungsverzüge umgehend mitgeteilt werden. Liefer- und Leistungszeitverschiebungen bedürfen der Zustimmung des Bundes. Falls zur Sicherstellung einer Lieferverpflichtung Zulieferungen bei einem anderen Lieferanten bezogen werden sollen, muss bei ausländischen Zulieferungen vorher die Zustimmung des Bundes eingeholt werden (Verschiebung in den Auslandsanteilen).

In der Corona-Pandemie kommt es jetzt insbesondere darauf an, schnell die notwendigen Ressourcen zur Verfügung zu stellen – insbesondere für die Kliniken, Ärzte und alle Verwaltungseinheiten, Einrichtungen und Personen, die an der Bewältigung der Pandemie arbeiten. Beschafferinnen und Beschaffer müssen tagtäglich innerhalb extrem kurzer Fristen versuchen, Material zur Aufrechterhaltung der Gesundheitsversordnung und der Arbeitsfähigkeit der öffentlichen Verwaltung insgesamt zu beschaffen.
Das Vergaberecht bietet eine Reihe von Möglichkeiten, in solchen Dringlichkeitssituationen dennoch schnell und effizient zu beschaffen. In der aktuellen Situation sind die Voraussetzungen für Dringlichkeitsvergaben sowohl im Ober- wie auch Unterschwellenbereich zweifelsohne gegeben. Diese und weitere Möglichkeiten hat das Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie (BMWi) in einem am 19. März versendeten Rundschreiben (PDF, 505 KB) umfassend dargestellt.
Die EU-Kommission hat im Rahmen einer am 1.

Jeśli do takiego kontaktu dojdzie, również domownicy mający kontakt będą musieli zostać objęci kwarantanną. Zasiłek przysługuje jedynie na ogólnych zasadach, czyli np. z tytułu choroby lub opieki nad chorym członkiem rodziny lub dzieckiem. Jeśli oczywiście zajdą ku temu przesłanki, różnica od zwyczajowej jest taka, że kwarantanna uniemożliwia sprawowanie takiej opieki przez osobę nią objętą. A zatem np. jeśli małżeństwo ma dziecko, które jest chore na grypę, a jedno z rodziców objęte jest kwarantanną, to tylko rodzic nieobjęty kwarantanną może sprawować opiekę nad chorym dzieckiem.

zalecenia,
e-zwolnienie,
e-receptę, 
sugestię bezpośredniej wizyty w placówce lub kontaktu ze stacją sanitarno-epidemiologiczną, jeśli będzie taka konieczność.

Teleporady medyczne:

ograniczają ryzyko rozprzestrzeniania się koronawirusa
ułatwiają izolację osób, które mogą zarażać wirusem innych
rozwiewają obawy, jeśli sytuacja jest niegroźna
skracają czas oczekiwania na wizyty u lekarzy.

Nie ma obaw, że teleporady uniemożliwią bezpośrednie wizyty u lekarzy. Jeśli po zdalnym wywiadzie będzie taka konieczność, pacjenci otrzymają sugestię skorzystania z wizyty w placówce medycznej lub skontaktowania się ze stacją sanitarno-epidemiologiczną. Dodatkowo, zgodnie z zaleceniami GIS w sprawie schematu postępowania dla Podstawowej Opieki Zdrowotnej oraz Nocnej i Świątecznej Opieki Zdrowotnej w związku z szerzeniem się nowego koronawirusa SARS-CoV-2, pacjenci powinni być szeroko informowani o konieczności kontaktu telefonicznego w celu ustalenia możliwości wizyty w przychodni.
Każdego pacjenta rejestracja powinna:

poinformować o możliwości uzyskania teleporady,
podczas rozmowy telefonicznej rejestracja powinna przeprowadzić ankietę wstępnej kwalifikacji w kierunku zakażenia koronawirusem SARS CoV-2.

Każdemu pacjentowi, również bez cech infekcji, zgłaszającemu chęć wizyty u lekarza najpierw należy udzielić teleporady. tylko w sytuacjach kiedy jest to niezbędne pacjent powinien zostać umówiony na konkretną godzinę do lekarza. Lekarz udzielający teleporady na podstawie przeprowadzonego wywiadu medycznego i oceny stanu zdrowia pacjenta ma możliwość wystawienia zwolnienia lekarskiego.
Schemat został uzgodniony z lekarzami Porozumienia Zielonogórskiego i zaakceptowany przez Konsultant Krajową w dziedzinie medycyny rodzinnej, prof. Agnieszkę Mastalerz-Migas.
UWAGA: ocena czy zasadne jest wystawienie w danej sytuacji (stanie zdrowia pacjenta) zwolnienia lekarskiego należy tylko i wyłącznie do danego lekarza. Jednocześnie decyzję o nałożeniu kwarantanny podejmuje państwowy powiatowy inspektor sanitarny. Taka decyzja jest tożsama ze zwolnieniem lekarskim i lekarz nie wystawia ZUS ZLA. Z wizyty na odległość (teleporady) mogą również skorzystać pacjenci kontynuujący opiekę w konkretnej poradni specjalistycznej (w ramach AOS), zgodnie z ustalonym planem leczenia i stanem klinicznym. Innymi słowy, z takiej porady nie może skorzystać pacjent, który zgłasza się do danej poradni po raz pierwszy lub jego stan zdrowia wymaga osobistej wizyty w poradni. O tym, czy dany pacjent może skorzystać z teleporady decyduje konkretny lekarz. Może on zdecydować o tym, że chce osobiście zbadać pacjenta, np. ze względu na konieczność przeprowadzenia badania fizykalnego, od którego zależeć będą dalsze decyzje diagnostyczno-terapeutyczne."

Jednak godziny teleporad ustalają placówki POZ. Ponadto po zebraniu wywiadu może się okazać, że stan pacjenta wymaga zbadania fizykalnego pacjenta w placówce lub pilnej interwencji w szpitalu.
Do sytuacji prawidłowych należy zatem:

wskazanie przez placówkę godziny, w której ma się odbyć teleporada,
wskazanie, że dany konkretny pacjent musi stawić się osobiście w przychodni celem zbadania fizykalnego przez lekarza/pielęgniarkę (dotyczy to zwłaszcza osób z chorobami przewlekłymi ale może mieć miejsce również w przypadku zgłoszenia telefonicznie niepokojących personel objawów),
przekazanie pacjentowi informacji, że w danej sytuacji musi się udać do innej placówki takiej jak SOR, IP lub wezwać pogotowie,
w celu wystawienia recepty, skierowania bądź zwolnienia pacjent zostanie poproszony o wizytę osobistą w przychodni (taka sytuacja może mieć miejsce szczególnie, gdy chodzi zalecanie nowych leków lub skierowanie na badania obrazowe, objawy opisane przez pacjenta niepokoją personel medyczny).

Jeśli natomiast POZ odmówi realizacji teleporady bez podana przyczyny lub nie odbędzie się ona w granicach wskazanych powyżej, pacjent ma następujące możliwości:

zgłoszenie się w tej sprawie do Kierownika danej placówki, z prośbą o interwencje,
złożenie skargi w Narodowym Funduszu Zdrowia na świadczeniodawcę, którym zawarł z NFZ umowę na realizację świadczeń opieki zdrowotnej (oddzielny skrypt)

wizyta u lekarza w przypadku leków nowych lub przy lekach stałych konieczność badań kontrolnych.

Dodatkowo ww. rozporządzenie określa liczbę zabiegów w trakcie pobytu (w tym tych z wykorzystaniem naturalnych surowców leczniczych). Obecnie obowiązujące przepisy ściśle określają minimalny, nieprzerwany czas trwania leczenia sanatoryjnego, która pozwala na uzyskanie efektu terapeutycznego. Skrócenie czasu trwania leczenia uzdrowiskowego, podzielenie go na części sprawia, że jest ono mniej skuteczne.

Takie osoby nie powinny opuszczać odpowiednio szpitala, miejsca kwarantanny lub izolacji. W odniesieniu do pozostałych osób wskazać należy, że zgodnie z komunikatem GIS w ostatnich tygodniach obserwuje się rosnącą liczbę zachorowań na COVID-19 – chorobę wywoływaną przez koronawirusa SARS-CoV-2 w Europie. Główny Inspektor Sanitarny rekomenduje zaniechanie podróży, zwłaszcza do krajów o wysokim ryzyku zakażenia się koronawirusem.
EKUZ potwierdza uprawnienia posiadacza do uzyskania w trakcie pobytu w innym państwie członkowskim świadczeń rzeczowych, które stają się niezbędne z powodów medycznych (niezależnie od czy przyczyną jest wypadek czy choroba zakaźna), z uwzględnieniem charakteru tych świadczeń oraz przewidywanego czasu pobytu.

Ważne: Osoba chcąca wyjechać do innego państwa członkowskiego Unii Europejskiej mimo zaleceń GIS powinna dodatkowo być świadoma, że: w części państw Unii Europejskiej obowiązują koszty współpłacenia pacjenta. Takie koszty mogą być bardzo wysokie w przypadku pobytu np. na oddziale intensywnej terapii. W zależności od przebiegu choroby oraz występujących powikłaniach COVID-19 może wymagać pobytu na oddziale intensywnej terapii. Jeśli dana osoba mimo wszystko decyduje się na wyjazd zaleca się rozważenie wykupienia dodatkowego komercyjnego ubezpieczenia, które będzie pokrywać ewentualne koszty współpłacenia; w czasie pobytu na terenie innego państwa członkowskiego służby sanitarne mogą poddać osobę chorą lub podejrzaną o zachorowanie podobnymi środkami nadzoru jak inspektor sanitarny w Polsce, oznacza to, że pobyt może zostać przymusowo wydłużony, co będzie się wiązać z dodatkowymi kosztami utrzymania oraz w przypadku osób aktywnych zawodowo dłuższą niż przewidywana nieobecnością w pracy."

"Odpowiedź na to pytanie zależy do tego, co pytający ma na myśli, pytając o zamknięcie.
Ograniczenie odwiedzin u chorych – szpital
Decyzję o ograniczeniu odwiedzin u chorych podejmuje kierownik danego podmiotu leczniczego, czyli w zależności od szpitala może to być np. dyrektor, prezes zarządu, komendant.
Czasowe zamknięcie placówki (przychodni, SOR, poradni) spowodowane koniecznością wdrożenia procedur sanitarno-epidemiologicznych
W przypadku zgłoszenia się do placówki leczniczej chorego z zachorowaniem lub podejrzeniem zachorowania na COVID-19, która nie jest szpitalem zakaźnym konieczne jest wdrożenia określonych procedur sanitarno-epidemiologicznych. Do takich procedur należy np. odsunięcie od pracy personelu medycznego mającego bezpośredni kontakt z chorym, konieczność przeprowadzenia dezynfekcji pomieszczeń, ograniczenie możliwość kontaktu z chorym kolejnych osób. W zależności od zaistniałych okoliczności (np. warunków lokalowych, obsady dyżurowej) przeprowadzenie niezbędnych procedur związane jest z koniecznością czasowego zamknięcia placówki. Przykładowo, jeśli w danym momencie przyjmuje jeden lekarz i będzie on miał bezpośredni kontakt z chorym, konieczności jego odsunięcia od pracy spowoduje konieczność wezwania innego lekarza, do czasu jego przyjazdu uzyskanie porady lekarskiej będzie w placówce niemożliwe. Podobnie jeśli zaistnieje konieczność dezynfekcji kluczowych dla działalności placówki pomieszczeń, to na ten czas nie będzie można w placówce uzyskać świadczenia opieki zdrowotnej. Takie zamknięcie placówki wynika bezpośrednio z obowiązujących procedur, są one wdrażane obligatoryjnie przez personel placówki w zależności od zaistniałej sytuacji.
Ograniczenie do niezbędnego minimum lub czasowe zawieszenie udzielania świadczeń wykonywanych planowo lub zgodnie z przyjętym planem postępowania leczniczego
W celu minimalizacji ryzyka transmisji infekcji COViD-19, Centrala NFZ zaleca ograniczenie do niezbędnego minimum lub czasowe zawieszenie udzielania świadczeń wykonywanych planowo lub zgodnie z przyjętym planem postępowania leczniczego. Dotyczy to przede wszystkim planowanych pobytów w szpitalach w celu: przeprowadzenia diagnostyki oraz zabiegów diagnostycznych, leczniczych i operacyjnych, prowadzenia rehabilitacji leczniczej, świadczeń z zakresu opieki psychiatrycznej i leczenia uzależnień, stomatologii, ambulatoryjnej opieki specjalistycznej, badań diagnostycznych wykonywanych ambulatoryjnie takich jak: tomografia komputerowa, rezonans magnetyczny, PET, gastroskopia, kolonoskopia, USG oraz badań profilaktycznych i przeprowadzania szczepień. W każdym przypadku odroczenia terminu udzielenia świadczenia, a szczególnie w razie podjęcia decyzji o zawieszeniu udzielania świadczeń należy ocenić i wziąć pod uwagę uwarunkowania i ryzyka dotyczące stanu zdrowia pacjentów i prawdopodobieństwo jego pogorszenia. Zaleca się także, w porozumieniu z właściwymi dyrektorami OW NFZ, całkowite zawieszenie udzielania świadczeń w mammobusach i dentobusach. Jednocześnie Centrala NFZ przypomina, że niektóre ze świadczeń mogą być udzielane z wykorzystaniem systemów teleinformatycznych lub innych systemów łączności. Nie dotyczy to tzw. porad pierwszorazowych.
Decyzję o ograniczeniu lub czasowym zawieszeniu udzielania świadczeń, biorąc pod uwagę wskazane powyżej zalecenia, podejmuje kierownictwo danego podmiotu leczniczego.
WAŻNE: w związku z wprowadzeniem stanu zagrożenia epidemiologicznego 19 placówek medycznych jest lub będzie przekształconych w szpitale zakaźne, co jest związane z ograniczeniem lub zawieszeniem przyjęć."

"W sytuacji gdy pacjent ma termin, ale obawia się z niego korzystać
Placówkom zaleca ograniczenie do niezbędnego minimum lub czasowe zawieszenie udzielania świadczeń wykonywanych planowo. Należy zatem skontaktować się z placówkę w której planowane jest leczenie. Jeśli ze względu na koronawirusa świadczeniodawca zawiesił udzielanie świadczeń, to wyznaczy nowy termin jego udzielenia. Jeśli w tym konkretnym przypadku świadczeniodawca decyduje się wykonać świadczenie, to  najprawdopodobniej potencjalne ryzyko związane z nieudzieleniem świadczenia w danym terminie i następstwa takiej decyzji przewyższają ryzyka związanego z zakażeniem COVID-19. Pacjent sam musi rozważyć, czy skorzysta z porady, czy nie.
Może skorzystać ze świadczenia lub poprosić o wyznaczenie innego terminu (w zależności od dostępnych terminów może być to termin odległy).
W sytuacji gdy pacjent nie może się zapisać
Proszę skorzystać z wyszukiwarki i znaleźć inny termin (może być on odległy)."

Stacja dializ na pewno udzieli informacji, jakie kroki podjęła w celu minimalizacji ryzyka zakażenia. Jednocześnie wskazać należy zostały wydane ogólne zalecenia dla podmiotów leczniczych. Przykładowo personel, który ma bliski kontakt z osobą chorą oraz osobą podejrzaną o zachorowanie na koronawirusa, zwykle zaopatrzony jest w odzież ochronną, która chroni go przed zakażeniem i co za tym idzie przeniesieniem zakażenia na kolejnych pacjentów. Jeśli dojdzie do bliskiego kontaktu personelu z osobą podejrzaną o zachorowanie, personel jest odsuwany od pracy do czasu otrzymania wyniku testu diagnostycznego tej osoby w kierunku koronawirusa (dalsze postępowanie w zależy od tego wyniku).

Decyzja inspektora sanitarnego stanowi podstawę do wypłaty świadczeń z tytułu choroby na ogólnych zasadach. Zatem za czas nieobecności w pracy z powodu kwarantanny lub izolacji przysługuje wynagrodzenie za czas choroby lub zasiłek chorobowy, wypłacane przez płatnika składek lub Zakład Ubezpieczeń Społecznych. Decyzja może być dostarczona do pracodawcy bądź do placówki ZUS po okresie kwarantanny lub izolacji.

Jeżeli lekarz leczący uzna, że w trakcie hospitalizacji, izolacji lub kwarantanny ze względu na stan zdrowia uzasadnione jest orzeczenie o czasowej niezdolności do pracy z powodu choroby i potwierdzi to wystawiając zaświadczenie lekarskie, ubezpieczony może ubiegać się o świadczenia z tytułu choroby na ogólnych zasadach.

Pamiętaj o higienie rąk oraz higienie kichania i kasłania, w szczególności przy pakowaniu żywności luzem, nieopakowanej, tj. pieczywo, produkty cukiernicze, orzechy.
Ręce w sklepie mają kontakt z powierzchniami roboczymi, pieniędzmi. Do pakowania  używaj dostępnych rękawic foliowych oraz torebek.
Niehigienicznym zachowaniem jest przebieranie i dotykanie produktów, które są przeznaczone do spożycia bez mycia i obróbki termicznej (np. pieczywo, bułki, wyroby cukiernicze).
Zwracaj uwagę na właściwą higienę układu oddechowego: nie kaszlaj lub/i nie kichaj w stronę innych osób czy towarów.

W domu: 

Zachowywaj właściwą higienę mycia i przygotowania żywności. Jest to priorytet nie tylko w przypadku koronawirusa, ale przede wszystkim typowych zanieczyszczeń mikrobiologicznych prowadzących do zatruć pokarmowych.

"Nein. Die Finanzminister von Bund und Ländern haben sich darauf verständigt, dass von der Corona-Krise betroffene Unternehmen ihre 2020 anfallenden Verluste bereits im laufenden Jahr teilweise mit Gewinnen aus 2019 verrechnen können sollen.Dieser ""vorgezogene Verlustrücktrag"" ist möglich für Kapitalgesellschaften und Steuerpflichtige mit Gewinneinkunftsarten (Land- und Forstwirtschaft, Gewerbebetrieb, Freiberufler) und mit Einkünften aus Vermietung und Verpachtung.Voraussetzung: Der Steuerpflichtige muss von der Corona-Krise unmittelbar und nicht unerheblich betroffen sein. Dies wird ohne weiteren Beleg vermutet, wenn der Steuerpflichtige die Vorauszahlungen für 2020 auf null Euro herabgesetzt hat und wenn er wahrheitsgemäß versichert, dass er im laufenden Jahr wegen der Corona-Krise nicht unerhebliche Verluste erwartet. Bezieht er noch andere Einkünfte als die genannten, ist das für den Antrag unschädlich. Und so funktioniert es: Betroffene müssen bis Ende März 2021 an das zuständige Finanzamt einen Antrag auf pauschalen Verlustrücktrag  stellen. Dieser beträgt 15 Prozent der Gewinn- beziehungsweise Vermietungseinkünfte, die der Berechnung der Vorauszahlungen für 2019 zugrunde gelegt wurden. In vielen Fällen dürften dies die jeweiligen Einkünfte aus dem Jahr 2018 oder 2017 sein. Die Obergrenze beträgt eine Million Euro (bei Zusammenveranlagung von Ehegatten zwei Millionen Euro). Für Kapitalgesellschaften ergibt sich somit ein maximaler Liquiditätszufluss von 150.000 Euro für die Körperschaftsteuer zuzüglich einem entsprechenden Anteil des Solidaritätszuschlags. Bei Personenunternehmen ist der Liquiditätseffekt vom persönlichen Steuersatz abhängig.Im Laufe des Jahres 2020 erfolgen die Steuerfestsetzungen für 2019. Wer einen pauschalen Verlustrücktrag erhalten hat, müsste dann in der Regel eine Nachzahlung leisten, weil der endgültige Verlustrücktrag erst im Rahmen der Festsetzungen für das Jahr 2020, also 2021 ermittelt wird.Eventuelle Nachzahlungen werden jedoch auf Antrag zinslos gestundet, bis die Festsetzung für 2020 erfolgt ist. Falls diese ergibt, dass der Steuerpflichtige einen geringeren als den pauschalen oder gar keinen Verlustrücktrag hätte erhalten dürfen, sind die gestundeten Nachzahlungen innerhalb eines Monats zu leisten.In dem BMF-Schreiben vom 24. April 2020 ist die Funktionsweise des pauschalen Verlustrücktrages anhand eines umfangreichen Beispiels erläutert. Sie finden das Papier auf der Website des Bundesfinanzministeriums."

Gibt es dafür Unterstützung?	"Die Bundesregierung hat ein Schutzschild für Unternehmen angeschoben, um Umsatzrückgänge infolge unterbrochener Lieferketten oder rückläufiger Nachfrage aufgrund des Coronavirus abzufedern. Für Einzelunternehmer und kleinere Betriebe mit bis zu zehn Vollzeit-Stellen gibt es bundesweit Soforthilfen, die Betroffene über die Bundesländer beantragen können. Dort gibt es in den meisten Fällen Ergänzungen durch kombinierte Landesprogramme.Unternehmen, die vorübergehend aufgrund der Corona-Krise in Finanzierungsengpässe geraten, können zusätzlich das KfW-Sonderprogramm 2020 nutzen: Für die Instrumente ""KfW-Unternehmerkredit"" und ""ERP-Gründerkredit Universell"" übernimmt die Bundesregierung nun 80 beziehungsweise 90 Prozent der Haftung. Zudem werden diese Programme auch für Großunternehmen geöffnet.Für größere Betriebe sind aber vor allem zinsgünstige Kredite mit langer Laufzeit und Absicherungen durch staatliche Förderbanken wie die bundeseigene KfW vorgesehen. Dazu zählt auch der am 6. April auf Initiative des DIHK beschlossene Schnellkredit für den Mittelstand, den die KfW ab dem 15. April verfügbar macht: Für Betriebe mit 11 bis 49 Mitarbeitern gibt es bis zu 500.000 Euro Kredit mit 100-prozentiger Haftungsfreistellung; Unternehmen ab 50 Mitarbeitern können bis zu 800.000 Euro erhalten. Die Laufzeiten betragen jeweils zehn Jahre mit Sondertilgungsmöglichkeiten ohne Vorfälligkeitsentscheidung bei jährlich drei Prozent Zinsen. Aber Achtung: Dieser Kredit ist nicht mit anderen Hilfsinstrumenten kombinierbar!Die KfW informiert über die bereits verfügbaren Corona-Sonderkredite auf ihrer Website. Sie hat außerdem eine telefonische Hotline geschaltet, die an Werktagen von 8 bis 18 Uhr besetzt ist: 0800 539 9000.Die Bundesregierung hat noch weitere Angebote angekündigt. Bekannt sind die folgenden Eckdaten:Der ""KfW Kredit für Wachstum"" steht künftig auch größeren Unternehmen ab einer Umsatzgrenze von fünf Milliarden (bisher zwei Milliarden) Euro zur Verfügung.Die Bürgschaftsbanken verdoppeln den Bürgschaftshöchstbetrag auf 2,5 Millionen Euro. Sie können Bürgschaftsentscheidungen bis 250.000 Euro eigenständig und innerhalb von drei Tagen fällen.Von dem eigentlich für Unternehmen in strukturschwachen Regionen aufgelegten Großbürgschaftsprogramm können auch Betriebe außerhalb solcher Regionen profitieren.Zudem stellt der Bund – ähnlich wie in der Finanzkrise von 2009 – Exportkreditgarantien (Hermesbürgschaften) bereit, um Unternehmen vor Zahlungsrisiken im Auslandsgeschäft zu schützen.Ferner hat die Bundesregierung am 1. April ein Volumen von 2 Milliarden Euro für die Stärkung der Beteiligungsfinanzierung bei Start-ups in Aussicht gestellt.Für große Unternehmen (beispielsweise solche mit mehr als 249 Mitarbeitern) steht künftig auch der Wirtschaftsstabilisierungsfonds bereit, der staatliche Beteiligungen ermöglichen soll.Weitere Informationen zum Schutzschild für Unternehmen sowie alle Maßnahmen und weiterführende Links finden Sie auf dieser Seite des Bundeswirtschaftsministeriums. Eine kostenlose Anfrage für ein Finanzierungsvorhaben können Sie über das Finanzierungsportal der Bürgschaftsbanken stellen. Die jeweils zuständige Bürgschaftsbank ist recherchierbar unter vdb-info.de.Darüber hinaus bieten auch Banken der Länder kurzfristige Liquiditätshilfen wie Betriebsmittelkredite für Unternehmen vor Ort an. Die Programme sind sehr unterschiedlich. Eine Übersicht dazu gibt es auf dieser Seite des Bundeswirtschaftsministeriums."

"Das Bundesfinanzministerium hat mit den Finanzverwaltungen der Bundesländer die beiden ersten ""Corona-Erlasse"" abgestimmt:Stundung von Steuerzahlungen: Wenn Unternehmen aufgrund der wirtschaftlichen Folgen der Corona-Pandemie in diesem Jahr fällige Steuerzahlungen nicht leisten können, sollen diese Zahlungen auf Antrag befristet und grundsätzlich zinsfrei gestundet werden. Den Antrag können Unternehmen bis zum 31. Dezember 2020 bei ihrem Finanzamt stellen. An die Bewilligung der Stundung sind dabei keine strengen Anforderungen zu stellen. Unternehmen müssen darlegen, dass sie unmittelbar betroffen sind. Den Wert entstandener Schäden müssen sie aber nicht im Einzelnen belegen. Damit wird die Liquidität der Steuerpflichtigen unterstützt, indem der Zeitpunkt der Steuerzahlung hinausgeschoben wird. Diese Maßnahme betrifft die Einkommen- und Körperschaftsteuer sowie die Umsatzsteuer. Der DIHK dringt auf pauschale Regelungen, die sehr schnell greifen müssen.Anpassung von Vorauszahlungen: Unternehmen, Selbständige und Freiberufler können außerdem die Höhe ihrer Vorauszahlungen auf die Einkommen- und Körperschaftsteuer anpassen lassen. Gleiches gilt für den Messbetrag für Zwecke der Gewerbesteuer-Vorauszahlungen. Hierfür können sie bei ihrem Finanzamt einen Antrag stellen. Sobald klar ist, dass die Einkünfte der Steuerpflichtigen im laufenden Jahr voraussichtlich geringer sein werden als vor der Corona-Pandemie erwartet, werden die Steuervorauszahlungen unkompliziert und schnell herabgesetzt. Die Liquiditätssituation wird dadurch verbessert. Unternehmen können schon jetzt, einen Antrag auf Herabsetzung ihrer Vorauszahlungen auf die Einkommen-, Körperschaft- und Gewerbesteuer beantragen. Die IHK München hat dazu einen einfachen Musterantrag entwickelt, den Sie auch hier herunterladen können (PDF, 36 KB).Vollstreckungsmaßnahmen aussetzen: Auf die Vollstreckung von überfälligen Steuerschulden soll bis zum Ende des Jahres verzichtet werden. Säumniszuschläge, die in dieser Zeit gesetzlich anfallen, sollen erlassen werden. Dies betrifft die Einkommen- und Körperschaftsteuer sowie die Umsatzsteuer.Zu vergleichbaren Maßnahmen hat das Bundesfinanzministerium darüber hinaus die Zollverwaltung angewiesen, die u.a. die Energiesteuer und Luftverkehrsteuer verwaltet. Sie gelten außerdem für die Versicherungssteuer und die Umsatzsteuer, soweit diese vom Bundeszentralamt für Steuern verwaltet wird.Auf der Website der Generalzolldirektion gibt es aktuelle Hinweise unter anderem zu Steuerstundungen oder Vollstreckungsaufschub. Auch das Bundesfinanzministerium informiert auf seiner Website."

"Ja, unter bestimmten Umständen können Arbeitgeber eine Stundung der bereits fällig gewordenen oder noch fällig werdenden Beiträge zunächst für die Ist-Monate März 2020 bis Mai 2020 beantragen.Stundungen sind zunächst längstens bis zum Fälligkeitstag für die Beiträge des Monats Juni 2020 zu gewähren. Dabei bedarf es weder einer Sicherheitsleistung, noch sind Stundungszinsen zu berechnen. Erfasst werden können auch Beiträge, die bereits vor dem vorgenannten Zeitraum fällig wurden. Das gilt unabhängig davon, ob bereits eine Stundungsvereinbarung geschlossen wurde oder andere Maßnahmen eingeleitet wurden. Wird dem Antrag des Arbeitgebers auf Stundung von Beitragsansprüchen entsprochen, gelten damit die Beiträge zur Kranken- und Pflegeversicherung für freiwillig krankenversicherte Arbeitnehmer, die vom Arbeitgeber im ""Firmenzahlerverfahren"" abgeführt werden, gleichermaßen als gestundet.Voraussetzung für den erleichterten Stundungszugang ist, dass die sofortige Einziehung der Beiträge ohne die Stundung trotz vorrangiger Inanspruchnahme von Kurzarbeitergeld, Fördermitteln und/oder Krediten mit erheblichen Härten für den Arbeitgeber verbunden wäre. Dabei ist in der Regel eine glaubhafte Erklärung des Arbeitgebers, dass er erheblichen finanziellen Schaden durch die Pandemie erlitten hat, ausreichend.Eine Pressemitteilung zum Thema finden Sie auf der Website des Krankenkassen-Spitzenverbandes GKV.Weiterführende Informationen und einen Musterantrag stellt die IHK Region Stuttgart auf ihrer Website zur Verfügung."

Dabei ist bei Selbstständigen zuvor zu prüfen, ob auch eine Beitragsermäßigung wegen eines krisenbedingten Gewinneinbruchs in Betracht käme. Falls ja, sind die Hürden für den Nachweis einer unverhältnismäßigen Belastung im Sinne des § 6 Abs. 3a und § 6a Abs. 3 der Beitragsverfahrensgrundsätze Selbstzahler abgesenkt.Bis auf Weiteres können die Krankenkassen anstelle der sonst vorgeschriebenen Vorauszahlungsbescheide auch andere Nachweise über die geänderte finanzielle Situation des Selbstständigen akzeptieren. Dies sind zum Beispiel Erklärungen von Steuerberatern, finanz- und betriebswirtschaftliche Auswertungen oder auch glaubhafte Erklärungen von Selbstständigen über erhebliche Umsatzeinbußen.

Die Insolvenzantragspflicht für Unternehmen ist aufgrund der Corona-Krise unter bestimmten Voraussetzungen bis zum 30.09.2020 ausgesetzt worden. Diese Aussetzung der Frist dient dem Schutz der Unternehmen: Sie sollen Zeit haben, um die notwendigen Vorkehrungen zur Beseitigung der Insolvenzreife zu treffen, insbesondere um zu diesem Zweck staatliche Hilfen oder andere Finanzierungs- und Sanierungshilfen in Anspruch zu nehmen.Voraussetzung für die Aussetzung der Antragspflicht:Der Insolvenzgrund beruht auf den Auswirkungen der Corona-Pandemie.Es besteht die Aussicht, dass die Zahlungsfähigkeit wiederhergestellt wird.Zur Entlastung der Antragspflichtigen enthält das Gesetz eine Vermutungsregelung: Bei bestehender Zahlungsfähigkeit am 31.12.2019 ist grundsätzlich vom Vorliegen der beiden vorgenannten Voraussetzungen auszugehen.Das Bundesjustizministerium kann die Aussetzung höchstens bis zum 31.03.2021 verlängern.Üblicherweise müssen bestimmte Unternehmen (juristische Personen wie GmbHs oder AGs sowie bestimmte Personengesellschaften) bei Überschuldung oder Zahlungsunfähigkeit innerhalb von drei Wochen einen Insolvenzantrag stellen.Vorsicht: Trotz Aussetzung der Antragspflicht kann die Stellung des Insolvenzantrags sinnvoll oder sogar erforderlich sein.

"Viele Unternehmen haben laufende Verpflichtungen aus Verträgen zum kontinuierlichen Bezug von wesentlichen Betriebsmitteln, die sie angesichts wegbrechenden Geschäfts nicht erfüllen können. Beispiel Strom: Hier zahlt ein Unternehmen monatliche Abschlagbeträge, ebenso beim Bezug von Gas oder Wasser. Gleiches gilt für den Internetanschluss oder die Nutzung von Telekommunikationsnetzen.Kleinstunternehmen (weniger als zehn Beschäftigte und weniger als zwei Millionen Euro Umsatz pro Jahr) haben seit dem 1. April 2020 das Recht, die Zahlung einstweilen zu verweigern. Diese Recht ist zunächst befristet bis zum 30. Juni 2020.Voraussetzungen:Es muss sich beim zugrundeliegenden Vertrag um ein ""wesentliches Dauerschuldverhältnis"" handeln. Das ist der Fall, wenn die Leistung fortlaufend bezogen wird und zur angemessenen Fortsetzung des Erwerbsbetriebs erforderlich ist. Für Strom, Gas, Wasser oder Telekommunikation kann man dies in aller Regel annehmen.Es muss ein privatrechtlicher Vertrag zugrunde liegen. Leistungen aufgrund kommunaler Satzungen sind nicht einbezogen. Bei der Wasserversorgung oder der Abwasser- oder Abfallentsorgung sind beide Gestaltungen in der Praxis verbreitet.Der Kunde kann die Zahlung aktuell infolge der Pandemie nicht erbringen oder würde mit einer Zahlung die wirtschaftliche Grundlage seines Erwerbsbetriebs gefährden.Die Ausübung der Leistungsverweigerung darf den Lieferanten nicht seinerseits in wirtschaftliche Schwierigkeiten bringen.Es ist ratsam, in jedem Fall einer beabsichtigen Zahlungsverweigerung mit dem Lieferanten Kontakt aufzunehmen, um eine für beide Seiten tragbare Lösung zu finden. Denn aufgeschoben ist nicht aufgehoben. Ist der Betrieb vorübergehend eingestellt, wird sich in den meisten Fällen auch der Leistungsbezug deutlich anders als geplant darstellen, also weniger Strom oder Wasser gebraucht. Es dürfte aber helfen, (zu hohe) Abschlagszahlungen für die Monate des Stillstands zu vermeiden, die die Liquidität belasten. Anders mag es sein, wenn Flatrates vereinbart wurden."

Die Fälligkeit der Ansprüche, die im Zeitraum vom 1. April bis 30. Juni 2020 zu erbringen sind, wird hiernach um drei Monate hinausgeschoben.Ein Anspruch, der am 2. Mai 2020 fällig würde, wäre somit bis zum Ablauf des 1. August 2020 gestundet; seine Fälligkeit wäre auf den 2. August 2020 verschoben. Voraussetzung der Stundung ist, dass der Darlehensnehmer aufgrund der durch das Auftreten des Coronavirus hervorgerufenen außergewöhnlichen Verhältnisse Einnahmeausfälle hat.

"Darauf gibt es keine pauschale Antwort, die immer stimmt. Denn vermeintlich ähnliche Einzelfälle sind in wichtigen Details unterschiedlich gelagert. Wer beispielsweise einfach Termine innerhalb Deutschlands mit der Begründung absagt, wegen des Coronavirus seien Reisen unmöglich, kann sich aktuell in der Regel nicht auf ""höhere Gewalt"" berufen.Anders kann der Fall liegen, wenn ein Betrieb vom örtlichen Gesundheitsamt unter Quarantäne gestellt wird oder eine Veranstaltung aufgrund einer behördlichen Anordnung abgesagt wird.Meistens empfiehlt sich bei aktuellen Problemen oder Stornierungen, mit Geschäftspartnern über einen fairen Ausgleich für beide Seiten zu sprechen und sich im Zweifel von Rechtsanwälten beraten zu lassen. Selbst bei Lieferausfällen im internationalen Handel können sich die Rechtsfolgen von vermeintlich oder auch tatsächlich höherer Gewalt stark unterscheiden – je nachdem, ob die Verträge nach deutschem oder angelsächsischen Recht geschlossen worden sind.Auch auf die Frage, in welcher Form eine vertragliche Force-Majeure-Klausel (französisch für ""höhere Gewalt"") im Zuge der Corona-Krise greift, gibt es die klassische Juristen-Antwort: Kommt darauf an.

Sowohl die rechtliche Einstufung als höhere Gewalt als auch die möglichen Rechtsfolgen sind jedoch stark vom Einzelfall abhängig und damit mit einiger Rechtsunsicherheit verbunden.Die IHK Stuttgart und die IHK Rhein-Neckar haben die rechtlichen Einschätzungen und Empfehlungen bezüglich ""Force Majeure"" gut aufbereitet.  Hinweis: Die IHKs in Deutschland sind nicht befugt, Erklärungen zu ""Force Majeure/Höhere Gewalt"" abzugeben beziehungsweise zu bescheinigen.

April 2020 für Mieter und Vermieter geändert?	Grundsätzlich sind die Mieter von Gewerberäumlichkeiten an ihre Mietverträge gebunden – aus dem Vertrag heraus besteht die rechtliche Verpflichtung, die eigene Miete zu bezahlen. Durch das neue Gesetz ist lediglich ein Kündigungsschutz vorgesehen, das heißt, Mietern und Pächtern kann für den Zeitraum vom 1. April bis 30. Juni 2020 nicht wegen ausgefallener Mietzahlungen aufgrund der Corona-Krise gekündigt werden. Miete oder Pacht bleiben jedoch weiter fällig, und es können auch Verzugszinsen entstehen.Eine Nichtzahlung der Miete vom 1. April bis 30. Juni 2020 muss damit begründet werden, dass die Zahlungsschwierigkeiten durch die Corona-Krise bedingt sind.Außerdem müssen etwaige Mietschulden, die im Zeitraum vom 1. April bis 30. Juni 2020 entstehen, bis zum 30. Juni 2022 nachgezahlt werden, andernfalls droht die Kündigung. Die Neuregelungen sind aber auch von dem Gedanken getragen, neue Lösungen für die Gewerbemiete zwischen Händler oder Gastronom auf der einen Seite und dem Vermieter auf der anderen Seite zu finden. Die IHK-Organisation empfiehlt, dass Mieter und Vermieter sich an einen Tisch setzen, um eine gemeinsame Lösung zu finden.Es gibt verschiedene Möglichkeiten für Sonderregelungen während der Corona-Krise. Eine Variante ist beispielsweise das Aussetzen der Mietzahlung vom 1. April bis zum 30. Juni 2020 – mit der Folge, dass danach die ausgesetzte Miete fällig wird. Eine andere Option ist es, gemeinsam zu überlegen, ob beispielsweise eine (vorübergehende) Verringerung der Miete möglich ist.Das Gesetz zur Abmilderung der Folgen der Covid-19-Pandemie im Zivil-, Insolvenz- und Strafverfahrensrecht können Sie hier als PDF-Dokument vom Server des Bundesministeriums für Justiz und Verbraucherschutz (BMJV) herunterladen. Die FAQ des BMJV zum Thema erreichen Sie auf der Website des Ministeriums.

Zur Miete zählen auch Untermietzuschläge, Zuschläge für gewerbliche Nutzung oder die besonders vereinbarte Vergütung für die Überlassung von Einrichtungsgegenständen.Sofern durch den Mieter eigene Verträge mit Versorgern abgeschlossen wurden (Strom, Wasser, Telefon et cetera) und Abschläge aufgrund der Pandemie nicht gezahlt werden können, sollte das Gespräch mit den Versorgern gesucht werden. Auch hier empfiehlt die IHK-Organisation, mit dem Vertragspartner eine Stundungsvereinbarung zu treffen.Im  Gesetz (das Sie hier als PDF-Dokument vom Server des Bundesjustizministeriums herunterladen können) finden Sie eine Regelung zum sogenannten Leistungsverweigerungsrecht.

Kurzarbeit ist die vorübergehende Verkürzung der üblichen Arbeitszeit. Der Arbeitnehmer muss weniger Stunden arbeiten, der Arbeitgeber zahlt dafür aber auch weniger Lohn. Das Arbeitsverhältnis besteht fort. Kurzarbeitergeld wird vom Staat gewährt, wenn in Betrieben die übliche Arbeitszeit wegen wirtschaftlicher Ursachen oder eines unabwendbaren Ereignisses vorübergehend verkürzt wird. Kurzarbeitergeld kann somit Entgeltausfall aufgrund von Kurzarbeit in Ihrem Betrieb zum Teil ausgleichen. Ob die Voraussetzungen für die Gewährung des Kurzarbeitergeldes vorliegen, entscheidet die zuständige Agentur für Arbeit.

Nein, die Ausbildungsdauer verlängert sich nicht.Die Ausbildung endet laut Gesetz mit dem Ablauf der Ausbildungsdauer (in der Regel zwei oder drei Jahre), also mit Ablauf des im Ausbildungsvertrag vereinbarten letzten Ausbildungstages. In der Regel bestehen Auszubildende aber vor Ablauf der vereinbarten Ausbildungsdauer die Abschlussprüfung.Wird die Abschlussprüfung bestanden, endet das Berufsausbildungsverhältnis mit Bekanntgabe des Ergebnisses. Im Falle des Nichtbestehens endet das Berufsausbildungsverhältnis mit Ablauf des im Ausbildungsvertrag vereinbarten letzten Ausbildungstages.Die Verschiebung der schriftlichen Prüfungen von April auf Juni bewirkt, dass in vielen Fällen auch die mündlichen und praktischen Prüfungen, welche in der Regel zuletzt abgenommen werden, später durchgeführt werden. Die Bekanntgabe des Prüfungsergebnisses wird deshalb voraussichtlich auch erst etwas später als in den Vorjahren erfolgen können. Bis dahin läuft das bestehende Ausbildungsverhältnis weiter, längstens bis zum vertraglich vereinbarten Enddatum.Auf Antrag des Auszubildenden bei der zuständigen IHK kann jedoch eine Verlängerung der Ausbildungszeit angefragt werden. Voraussetzung: Die Verlängerung ist erforderlich, um das Ausbildungsziel zu erreichen. Diese kann bei einer längeren Corona-bedingten Ausfallzeit der Berufsausbildung im Betrieb oder in der Berufsschule durchaus der Fall sein.

Die zuständige IHK wird dann den Ausbildungsvertrag um die Zeitdauer verlängern, die zum Ablegen der Abschlussprüfung erforderlich ist.

Während die praktischen Prüfungen voraussichtlich bereits im Mai beginnen, finden die schriftlichen Prüfungen später statt. Diese zeitliche Verschiebung dient dem Schutz der Gesundheit der Prüflinge: Die schriftlichen Prüfungen werden an bundesweit einheitlich festgelegten Terminen abgenommen, bei denen viele Teilnehmer in großen Räumen ihre schriftliche Prüfung ablegen. Dort besteht eine hohe Gefahr der Übertragung von Krankheiten. Schriftliche Prüfungen müssen deshalb so lange verschoben werden, bis diese aktuell hohe Ansteckungsgefahr das übliche Maß nicht mehr übersteigt.Bei praktischen Prüfungen sieht die Situation je nach Beruf gänzlich anders aus. Es ist denkbar, dass der Auszubildende bei der Durchführung seiner praktischen Prüfung mit nur sehr wenigen oder gar keiner dritten Person in physischen Kontakt kommt. Die praktischen Prüfungen können deshalb – unter Berücksichtigung des Einzelfalls – in der Regel zu einem früheren Zeitpunkt durchgeführt werden.

Eine Freistellung von der Ausbildung ist nur in den gesetzlich ausdrücklich vorgesehenen Fällen (§ 15 Abs. 1 BBiG) möglich. Eine darüber hinaus gehende Freistellung verstößt immer – ob bezahlt oder unbezahlt – gegen die Verpflichtung des Ausbilders, berufliche Handlungsfähigkeit zu vermitteln (§ 14 Abs. 1 Nr. 1 BBiG). Das heißt, dass weder eine schlechte Auftragslage noch ein behördliches Verbot, die Ausbildungsstätte weiter zu betreiben, Gründe für eine Freistellung von Auszubildenden sind.Ausbilder sind im Einzelfall schadenersatzpflichtig, wenn sie die Auszubildenden dennoch von der Ausbildung freistellen und den Auszubildenden dadurch finanzielle Nachteile entstehen.

All diejenigen sollen zügig und ohne viel bürokratischen Aufwand Zuschüsse beantragen können, die sie dabei unterstützen, ihre berufliche Existenz zu sichern. Der Berliner Senat setzt alles daran, dass alle Berliner*innen gut durch die Krise kommen. In einer ersten Phase vom 27.03.2020 bis zum 01.04.2020 konnten in Berlin über 100.000 Selbstständige, Freiberufler*innen und Kleinstunternehmen über die IBB Soforthilfen aus Landes- und Bundesmitteln abrufen.

    Sollten Sie zu einer der genannten Gruppen gehören, beachten Sie bitte folgende Punkte, die als Voraussetzung für die Hilfen erfüllt sein müssen:
  

Es muss im Einzelfall nachgewiesen bzw. glaubhaft gemacht werden, dass ein Zuschuss für die Sicherung der beruflichen bzw. betrieblichen Existenz in der Corona-Krise erforderlich ist.
    
Im Rahmen der Antragstellung soll erklärt werden, dass Hilfsprogramme des Bundes oder andere zur Verfügung stehende Hilfsprogramme bzw. Ansprüche aus der sozialen Sicherung und anderen gesetzlichen Leistungen (z. B. Kurzarbeitergeld, Grundsicherung) in Anspruch genommen bzw. beantragt werden.
    
Über- oder Doppelkompensationen durch die Inanspruchnahme von Mitteln aus anderen Maßnahmen oder Programmen sollen von vornherein vermieden bzw. im Nachhinein korrigiert werden. Der Zuschuss übernimmt deshalb auch die Funktion einer Liquiditätshilfe bis zur Klärung und Inanspruchnahme anderer Ansprüche.
    
Die Höhe des für Betriebsmittel vorgesehenen Zuschusses wird für Unternehmen mit maximal fünf Beschäftigten auf 9.000 Euro begrenzt, bei Unternehmen bis zehn Beschäftigten liegt die Begrenzung bei 15.000 Euro. Der Zuschuss kann gegebenenfalls mehrmals beantragt werden. Das gilt jedoch nur für den Fall, dass sie zuvor nur Landesmittel beantragt haben und jetzt Bundesmittel beantragen möchten.

"Wegbrechende Aufträge oder behördliche Betriebsschließungen sowie die daraus folgenden Liquiditätsprobleme sind grundsätzlich kein Grund für die Kündigung eines Berufsausbildungsverhältnisses. Das ergibt sich rechtlich aus den „Hauptleistungspflichten“ im Berufsausbildungsverhältnis.
    Ausbildende müssen dafür sorgen, dass den Auszubildenden die berufliche Handlungsfähigkeit im Ausbildungsberuf vermittelt wird (§ 14 Absatz 1 Nr. 1 BBiG).
  

    Erst wenn aufgrund der wirtschaftlichen Schwierigkeiten kein Ausbildungspersonal mehr vorhanden ist, die berufliche Handlungsfähigkeit deshalb gar nicht mehr vermittelt werden kann oder wenn der Betrieb endgültig schließt oder wenn Auszubildenden die Vergütung nicht mehr gezahlt werden kann, haben beide Seiten rechtlich einen sogenannten wichtigen Grund zur fristlosen Kündigung des Berufsausbildungsverhältnisses (§ 22 Absatz 2 Nr. 1 BBiG).
  

    Auszubildende dürfen auch nicht pauschal in „Zwangsurlaub” geschickt werden. Urlaub muss beantragt werden und darf in der Regel nicht gegen den Willen des Auszubildenden einfach angeordnet werden. Ähnlich ist das beim Abbau von Überstunden. Der Auszubildende selbst oder auch der Betriebsrat können eine Vereinbarung mit der Unternehmensleitung treffen. Hier zählt der Einzelfall. Betriebsurlaub kann der Arbeitgeber im Rahmen seines Direktionsrechts grundsätzlich anordnen. Allerdings nicht nur für Auszubildende, sondern es muss eine generelle Regelung geben."

Betriebsrisikolehre, § 615 Satz 3 BGB). Dazu würden etwa Fälle zählen, in denen es aufgrund von COVID-19-Erkrankungen zu erheblichen Personalausfällen oder Versorgungsengpässen käme, in deren Folge der Arbeitgeber die Betriebstätigkeit vorübergehend einstellen würde.

"Ist der Arbeitnehmer selbst als Betroffener Adressat einer behördlichen Maßnahme, wie z.B. Tätigkeitsverbot oder Quarantäne, kann er einen Entgeltanspruch gegen seinen Arbeitgeber haben. Aus Sicht des BGH kann in einem solchen Fall ein vorübergehender, in der Person des Arbeitnehmers liegender Verhinderungsgrund bestehen, der den Arbeitgeber trotz Wegfalls der Pflicht zur Arbeitsleistung zur Entgeltfortzahlung verpflichtet (§ 616 BGB). Die Dauer der Entgeltfortzahlung hängt von den Umständen des Einzelfalles ab (vgl. BGH, Urteil vom 30. November 1978, III ZR 43/77 – nach dieser Entscheidung für höchstens 6 Wochen).
In Fällen, in denen § 616 BGB durch Einzel- oder Tarifvertrag eingeschränkt oder ausgeschlossen ist oder aus anderen Gründen nicht greift, besteht in vielen Konstellationen ein öffentlich-rechtlicher Entschädigungsanspruch. Personen, die als Ansteckungsverdächtige auf Anordnung des zuständigen Gesundheitsamts isoliert werden und deshalb einen Verdienstausfall erleiden, erhalten eine Entschädigung nach § 56 des Infektionsschutzgesetzes. Die Entschädigung bemisst sich nach dem Verdienstausfall. Für die ersten sechs Wochen wird sie in Höhe des Verdienstausfalls gewährt. Vom Beginn der siebten Woche an wird sie in Höhe des Krankengeldes gewährt. Arbeitnehmer erhalten von ihrem Arbeitgeber für die Dauer der Isolierung, längstens für sechs Wochen, eine Entschädigung in Höhe des Nettolohns. Die ausgezahlten Beträge werden dem Arbeitgeber auf Antrag erstattet. Nach sechs Wochen zahlt der Staat in Höhe des Krankengeldes weiter. Erkrankte fallen nicht unter diese Entschädigungsregelung, weil diese bereits Lohnfortzahlung im Krankheitsfall und Krankengeld erhalten."

"Lieferengpässe, die im Zusammenhang mit dem Coronavirus entstehen, oder behördliche Betriebsschließungen mit der Folge, dass die Betriebe ihre Produktion einschränken oder einstellen müssen, können zu einem Anspruch auf Kurzarbeitergeld für die vom Arbeitsausfall betroffenen Beschäftigten führen.
Betriebe, die Kurzarbeitergeld beantragen möchten, müssen die Kurzarbeit zuvor bei der zuständigen Agentur für Arbeit anzeigen. 
Ob die Voraussetzungen für die Gewährung des Kurzarbeitergelds vorliegen, prüft die zuständige Agentur für Arbeit im Einzelfall.
Kurzarbeitergeld kann für eine Dauer von bis zu zwölf Monaten bewilligt werden. Kurzarbeitergeld wird in derselben Höhe wie Arbeitslosengeld bezahlt und beträgt 67 bzw. 60 Prozent der Differenz zwischen dem pauschalierten Nettoentgelt, das ohne Arbeitsausfall gezahlt worden wäre, und dem pauschaliertem Nettoentgelt aus dem tatsächlich erhaltenen Arbeitsentgelt.

Für das Eingreifen eines Leistungsverweigerungsrechts wäre es erforderlich, dass ihm die Erbringung seiner Arbeitsleistung unzumutbar ist (§ 275 Abs. 3 BGB). Eine Unzumutbarkeit ist z.B. dann gegeben, wenn die Arbeit für den Betroffenen eine erhebliche objektive Gefahr oder zumindest einen ernsthaften objektiv begründeten Verdacht der Gefährdung für Leib oder Gesundheit darstellt.

Arbeitnehmer sind grundsätzlich nur dann zur Leistung von Überstunden verpflichtet, wenn sich dies aus einem Tarifvertrag, einer Betriebsvereinbarung oder einem Arbeitsvertrag ergibt. Es kann jedoch auch eine Nebenpflicht zur Leistung von Überstunden bestehen, wenn durch die geforderten Überstunden ein sonst dem Arbeitgeber drohender Schaden, der auf andere Weise nicht abgewendet werden kann, vermieden wird. Dies könnte auch dann der Fall sein, wenn es beispielsweise aufgrund von COVID-19-Erkrankungen zu erheblichen Personalausfällen kommt.
Besteht keine arbeits- oder kollektivvertragliche Bestimmung über die Bezahlung der Überstunden, kann der Arbeitnehmer grundsätzlich gem. § 612 BGB die Grundvergütung für die Überstunden verlangen.

"Jeder Arbeitnehmer hat seinem Arbeitgeber die Arbeitsunfähigkeit und deren voraussichtliche Dauer unverzüglich, d. h. ohne schuldhaftes Zögern anzuzeigen (§ 5 Abs. 1 Satz 1 Entgeltfortzahlungsgesetz - EFZG). Dies kann z. B. telefonisch geschehen. Dauert die Arbeitsunfähigkeit länger als 3 Kalendertage ist der Arbeitnehmer verpflichtet, dem Arbeitgeber spätestens am darauffolgenden Arbeitstag eine ärztliche Bescheinigung über das Bestehen der Arbeitsunfähigkeit und deren voraussichtliche Dauer vorzulegen (§ 5 Abs. 1 S. 2 EFZG). Der Arbeitgeber ist berechtigt, die Vorlage der Arbeitsunfähigkeitsbescheinigung früher zu verlangen. Allerdings kann der Arbeitgeber die Vorlage auch zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt verlangen oder vorübergehend darauf verzichten. In der aktuellen Situation wird empfohlen, Rücksprache zum konkreten Vorgehen mit dem Arbeitgeber zu halten.
Soweit Erkrankte zunächst die Arbeitsunfähigkeitsbescheinigung nicht an ihren Arbeitgeber übermitteln können (z.B. wegen überlasteter Arztpraxen), kann dem Arbeitgeber die Bescheinigung auch später vorgelegt werden.

Fällt unter die Gefährdungsbeurteilung für seine Mitarbeiter*innen auch der Schutz vor ansteckenden Krankheiten?	"Der Arbeitgeber hat nach Arbeitsschutzgesetz grundsätzlich die Verpflichtung die Gefahren für die Sicherheit und Gesundheit für seine Beschäftigten am Arbeitsplatz zu beurteilen (sog. Gefährdungsbeurteilung) und Maßnahmen hieraus abzuleiten. Im Rahmen der Pandemieplanung (Bevölkerungsschutz) hat der Arbeitgeber ggf. weitere Maßnahmen zu ermitteln und durchzuführen. Konkrete Hinweise hierzu finden sich zum Beispiel im Nationalen Pandemieplan auf der Homepage des RKI.
Für den Arbeitsschutz gilt, wenn eine beschäftigte Person aufgrund ihrer Arbeit mit biologischen Arbeitsstoffen umgeht, ist die Biostoffverordnung anzuwenden (§ 4 BioStoffV). Biostoffe wie Viren, Bakterien etc. müssen in der Gefährdungsbeurteilung berücksichtigt werden. Aus den Gefährdungen muss der Arbeitgeber Schutzmaßnahmen für seine Beschäftigten ableiten und umsetzen. Die Maßnahmen können technisch und organisatorisch sein, wie etwa die Abtrennung der Arbeitsbereiche oder die Beschränkung der Mitarbeiterzahl. Bei entsprechender Gefährdung hat der Arbeitgeber außerdem persönliche Schutzausrüstung wie beispielsweise Schutzhandschuhe oder Atemschutz zur Verfügung zu stellen. Zu den Gefährdungen sind die Beschäftigten über eine Unterweisung allgemein sowie über eine arbeitsmedizinische Vorsorge individuell zu beraten. Konkretisierungen enthalten beispielsweise die Technische Regel ""Biologische Arbeitsstoffe im Gesundheitswesen und in der Wohlfahrtspflege"" (TRBA 250) oder der Beschluss 609 „Arbeitsschutz beim Auftreten einer nicht ausreichend impfpräventablen humanen Influenza“, welcher derzeit in der Prävention von COVID-19 analog Anwendung findet.

"In Bezug auf das Arbeitsrecht ergeben sich für Grenzgänger nach Deutschland insoweit keine Besonderheiten. Es gelten grundsätzlich die Ausführungen zu den übrigen Fragen. Für Grenzgänger aus Deutschland in einen Nachbarstaat gilt regelmäßig das Arbeitsrecht des jeweiligen Staates.
Nach deutschem Recht trägt der Arbeitnehmer das Risiko, zur Arbeit zu gelangen (sog. Wegerisiko). Kann der Arbeitnehmer nicht zum Betrieb gelangen, so kann er seine Arbeit nicht anbieten und erhält auch kein Gehalt, es sei denn, es ist etwas anderes vereinbart worden. Abmahnungen oder verhaltensbedingte Kündigungen hingegen können nur bei Verschulden des Arbeitnehmers ausgesprochen werden; daran fehlt es bei einer Notlage.
In Bezug auf das Sozialversicherungsrecht gilt: Der Anspruch auf Leistungen wie Krankentagegeld und Kurzarbeitergeld richtet sich nach dem Recht des zuständigen Mitgliedstaates, also dem Staat, in dem Sie auch bislang sozialversichert sind. In der Regel ist das der Beschäftigungsstaat. Grenzgänger nach Deutschland können daher bei Arbeitsausfall im deutschen Unternehmen Kurzarbeitergeld erhalten. Für Grenzgänger aus Deutschland gilt das Recht des Beschäftigungsstaates.
Vorübergehende Corona-bedingte Telearbeit führt nicht zu einer Änderung des anwendbaren Rechts in der Sozialversicherung. Sie bleiben im gleichen Staat sozialversichert wie bisher."

Hier werden spezifische Schutzmaßnahmen beschrieben. Außerdem ist arbeitsmedizinische Vorsorge nach der Verordnung zur arbeitsmedizinischen Vorsorge anzubieten. SARS-CoV-2 ist als biologischer Arbeitsstoff in die Risikogruppe 3 eingestuft. Für diagnostische Laboratorien gilt ein gestuftes Verfahren entsprechend des Beschlusses des Ausschusses für Biologische Arbeitsstoffe (ABAS) vom 19.02.2020.
Der Schutz aller übrigen Beschäftigten, bei deren Tätigkeit der Kontakt zu infizierten Personen nicht ausgeschlossen werden kann (beispielsweise in Bereichen mit Publikumsverkehr oder mit Kontakt zu einer Vielzahl von Menschen) richtet sich nach dem Pandemieplan der jeweiligen Landesregierung. Für Tätigkeiten bei denen eine Gefährdung von Beschäftigten durch Kontakt zu infizierten Personen nicht ausgeschlossen werden kann, sieht das Infektionsschutzgesetz (IfSG) die Möglichkeit vor, die erforderlichen Schutzmaßnahmen aus dem Pandemieplan durch ordnungsbehördliche Anordnung durchzusetzen. Adressat der Anordnungen unter anderem in Form von Erlassen ist auch der Arbeitgeber. Bei der Umsetzung der Schutzmaßnahmen (sogenannte betriebliche Pandemieplanung) kann der Arbeitgeber sich fachlich von Betriebsarzt und Fachkraft für Arbeitssicherheit beraten lassen (vgl.

"Der Normalfall ist, dass die Betriebsratsmitglieder zu einer Sitzung zusammenkommen; die Nutzung von Video- oder Telefonkonferenzen ist nicht explizit im Betriebsverfassungsgesetz vorgesehen.
Für die Dauer der Coronavirus-Pandemie liegt nach Auffassung des BMAS eine Sondersituation vor, in der die Betriebsratssitzung mittels Video- oder Telefonkonferenz (einschließlich online gestützter Anwendungen wie WebEx Meetings oder Skype) zulässig ist, wenn eine Anwesenheit im Betrieb nicht gewährleistet werden kann, weil z.B. eine Präsenzsitzung zu Gefahren für das Leben oder die Gesundheit der Betriebsratsmitglieder führt oder die Teilnahme an einer Präsenzsitzung wegen behördlicher Anordnungen nicht möglich ist. In diesem Rahmen ist es dann sowohl zulässig, einzelne Betriebsratsmitglieder mittels Video- oder Telefonkonferenz teilnehmen zu lassen, als auch eine vollständig virtuelle Betriebsratssitzung durchzuführen. Auch bei einer Video- oder Telefonkonferenz muss der Grundsatz der Nichtöffentlichkeit gewahrt bleiben. Es ist also sicherzustellen, dass unberechtigte Dritte vom Inhalt der Sitzung keine Kenntnis nehmen können.
Weil es eine handschriftlich unterzeichnete Anwesenheitsliste in diesem Fall nicht geben kann, sollte die Teilnahme gegenüber dem Betriebsratsvorsitzenden in Textform, also zum Beispiel per E-Mail bestätigt werden.
Hinweis: Auf Vorschlag des BMAS ist eine befristete gesetzliche Sonderregelung in das parlamentarische Verfahren eingebracht worden, die während der Coronavirus-Pandemie gelten und abschließende Rechtssicherheit für in dieser Zeit mittels Video- und Telefonkonferenz gefasste Beschlüsse bieten wird."

"Al termine del periodo di isolamento fiduciario, se non sono comparsi sintomi, la persona può rientrare al lavoro ed il periodo di assenza risulta coperto dal certificato emesso all’inizio del periodo di isolamento. 


	Qualora durante il periodo di isolamento fiduciario la persona dovesse sviluppare sintomi, il Dipartimento di Sanità Pubblica, che si occupa della sorveglianza sanitaria, provvederà all’esecuzione del tampone per la ricerca di SARS-CoV-2. In caso di esito positivo dello stesso bisognerà attendere la guarigione clinica (cioè la totale assenza di sintomi). A quel punto verranno effettuati due tamponi di conferma di avvenuta guarigione a distanza di 24 ore l’uno dall’altro. Se entrambi i tamponi risulteranno negativi la persona potrà tornare a lavoro, altrimenti proseguirà  l’isolamento fiduciario.

"I sintomi più comuni di Covid-19 sono febbre, stanchezza e tosse secca. Alcuni pazienti possono presentare indolenzimento e dolori muscolari, congestione nasale, naso che cola, mal di gola o diarrea. Questi sintomi sono generalmente lievi e iniziano gradualmente. Nei casi più gravi, l'infezione può causare polmonite, sindrome respiratoria acuta grave, insufficienza renale e persino la morte.


	Recentemente, l'anosmia/iposmia (perdita /diminuzione dell'olfatto), e in alcuni casi l'ageusia (perdita del gusto) sono state segnalate come sintomi legati all'infezione da Covid-19. I dati provenienti dalla Corea del Sud, dalla Cina e dall'Italia mostrano che in alcuni casi i pazienti con infezione confermata da SARS-CoV-2 hanno sviluppato anosmia/iposmia in assenza di altri sintomi.

 
	I sintomi più comuni di Covid-19 sono febbre, stanchezza e tosse secca. Alcuni pazienti possono presentare indolenzimento e dolori muscolari, congestione nasale, naso che cola, mal di gola o diarrea. Questi sintomi sono generalmente lievi e iniziano gradualmente. Nei casi più gravi, l'infezione può causare polmonite, sindrome respiratoria acuta grave, insufficienza renale e persino la morte.

È probabile che i fumatori siano più vulnerabili al virus SARS-CoV-2 in quanto l'atto del fumo fa sì che le dita (ed eventualmente le sigarette contaminate) siano a contatto con le labbra, il che aumenta la possibilità di trasmissione del virus dalla mano alla bocca. I fumatori possono anche avere già una malattia polmonare sottostante o una ridotta capacità polmonare che aumenterebbe notevolmente il rischio di sviluppare forme di malattia gravi, come la polmonite.

Per questo molti centri hanno modificato la loro operatività e adottato procedure locali per l’assistenza ordinaria, la consegna dei farmaci antiretrovirali, i prelievi e la gestione delle urgenze delle persone con HIV. Verificate con il vostro medico/centro come comportarvi. Per tutto ciò che non riveste carattere di urgenza, molti centri hanno provveduto a posticipare gli appuntamenti.
	Le modifiche delle normali procedure sono state adottate al fine di ridurre l’afflusso di persone presso gli ospedali,come da indicazioni di sanità pubblica diramate a tutta la popolazione. Naturalmente, se avete concordato la necessità di recarvi al centro clinico, ricordate di portare con voi l’autocertificazione necessaria per ogni spostamento.

Du som resenär behöver göra en egen bedömning av ditt resande utifrån behovet av att resa och den information om smittspridningen som finns. Information finns tillgänglig på vår webbplats, men även resmålets egna myndigheter eller andra webbplatser tillhandahåller officiell information. Exempel på sådana webbplatser är WHO:s och ECDC:s webbplatser, som redovisar siffror från respektive land med någon dags eftersläpning från det att länderna officiellt rapporterar.
På International Air Transport Associations (IATA) webbplats finns reseinformation från olika länder sammanställd men kontrollera alltid med det land du planerar att resa till eller via. Om du har en nära förestående resa bör du ta kontakt med din researrangör alternativt ditt försäkringsbolag om du har frågor om av- eller ombokning.

RekommendationEn rekommendation är varken bindande eller kopplad till en bindande regel (till skillnad från ett allmänt råd). Däremot bygger en rekommendation på all den kunskap som finns inom ett visst ämne. Det är därför en god idé att följa en rekommendation som kommer från en myndighet.

WHO is actively following the ongoing clinical trials that are being conducted in response to COVID-19, including studies looking at the use of chloroquine and its derivative, hydroxychloroquine, for treatment and/or prevention. Currently, there is insufficient data to assess the efficacy of either of these medicines in treating patients with COVID-19, or in preventing them from contracting the coronavirus. Chloroquine is currently recommended by WHO for the treatment of P. vivax malaria. In the context of the COVID-19 response, the dosage and treatment schedules for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine that are currently under consideration do not reflect those used for treating patients with malaria. The ingestion of high doses of these medicines may be associated with adverse or seriously adverse health outcomes. For public health emergencies, WHO has a systematic and transparent process for research and development (R&D), including for clinical trials of drugs. The WHO “R&D Blueprint” for COVID-19, initiated on 7 January 2020, aims to fast-track the availability of effective tests, vaccines and medicines that can be used to save lives and avert large-scale crises. WHO has also designed a set of procedures to assess the performance, quality and safety of medical technologies during emergency situations.

WHO guidance remains the same. Countries should not scale back efforts to detect and treat malaria; doing so would seriously undermine the health and well-being of millions of people infected with a potentially life-threatening disease.As signs and symptoms of malaria and COVID-19 can overlap (such as a fever), public health messages will need to be adapted in malaria-endemic settings so that people who have a fever are encouraged to seek immediate treatment rather than stay at home; without prompt treatment, a mild case of malaria can rapidly progress to severe illness and death.

"The most widely used antimalarial treatments, artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), are produced using the pure artemisinin compound extracted from the plant Artemisia annua. In recent years, some news reports have suggested that
    a range of non-pharmaceutical products made from Artemisia plant material – such as herbal teas and tablets – may be effective in preventing or treating malaria. Now, there are reports that products made from Artemisia plant material may also have a preventive or curative effect on COVID-19. WHO urges extreme caution over reports touting the efficacy of such products. As explained in a WHO position statement,
 there is no scientific evidence base to support the use of non-pharmaceutical forms of Artemisia for the prevention or treatment of malaria. There is also no evidence to suggest that COVID-19 can be prevented or treated with products made from
    Artemisia-based plant material."

The WHO Global Malaria Programme is leading a cross-partner effort to mitigate the negative impact of the coronavirus in malaria-affected countries and, where possible, contribute towards a successful COVID-19 response. The work is being carried out in close collaboration with colleagues based at WHO headquarters, regional offices and country level.In March 2020, before the pandemic had secured a strong footing in Africa, WHO sounded an urgent call for maintaining core malaria prevention and treatment services while protecting health workers and communities against COVID-19 transmission. The findings of a modelling analysis from WHO and partners, published in April, reinforced the WHO call for continuity of malaria services during then pandemic.In collaboration with partners, WHO developed technical guidance for countries on how to safely maintain malaria prevention and treatment in COVID-19 settings. Tailoring malaria interventions in the COVID-19 response is consistent with broader WHO guidance on how to maintain essential health services during the pandemic.

Temperature screening alone, at exit or entry, is not an effective way to stop international spread, since infected individuals may be in incubation period, may not express apparent symptoms early on in the course of the disease, or may dissimulate fever through the use of antipyretics; in addition, such measures require substantial investments for what may bear little benefits. It is more effective to provide prevention recommendation messages to travellers and to collect health declarations at arrival, with travellers’ contact details, to allow for a proper risk assessment and a possible contact tracing of incoming travellers. Event organizers should also consider the capacity to undertake this and the management of suspected cases. However, sporting organizations may have criteria for participation that are stricter than government requirements for Ports of Entry into the country that are based on event risk assessment, including organizers' healthcare capacity.Any additional screening questionnaires for participation in events need to be aligned with public health agencies in the jurisdiction. There is a need to consider how to manage different groups – athletes, officials and spectators, and the large numbers of individuals likely to arrive at a sporting event from many oversea countries – and to follow both host country and WHO travel advice and to assess whether there is difficulty in obtaining accurate information about the travel history of those individuals.

Agreed health criteria are needed for the exclusion of athletes from competing and for allowing them to return to competition wherever appropriate. These should be consistent with public health guidelines for the general population, with risk profiles based on recent travel to high-risk community transmission zones, recent contact with individuals diagnosed with or suspected of having COVID-19, current symptomatology, etc. Athletes who are feeling unwell should not participate in events.If testing of athletes has been agreed with the local public health service there is a need to consider test availability, time taken for receipt of test results and host-country health services capacity. Criteria for exclusion of officials/judges from competition and for allowing them to return to competition where appropriate should follow guidance and criteria for the workplace.Requirements for the attendance of all athletes and other accredited participants should be put in place:–   health check: travel declaration and temperature screening–   contact tracing protocols ready (with all details of those present) –   allowing extra spacing (physical distancing)–   following all hygiene precautions.  Isolation procedures for athletes and other accredited participants (e.g. field-of-play staff, medical teams, officials who have close contact with the athletes) who feel unwell or become symptomatic should be clear and documented and rehearsed prior to holding the event, especially for higher risk sports, e.g. contact sports.

High profile international sporting events such as the Olympics or World Cups as well as international religious events such as the Hajj count as mass gatherings. However, lower profile conferences and events can also meet WHO’s definition of a mass gathering. An event counts as a “mass gatherings” if the number of people it brings together is so large that it has the potential to strain the planning and response resources of the health system in the community where it takes place. You need to consider the location and duration of the event as well as the number of participants. For example, if the event takes place over several days in a small island state where the capacity of the health system is quite limited then even an event with just a few thousand participants could place a big strain on the health system and then be considered a “mass gathering” event. Conversely, if the event is held in a big city in a country with a large, well-resourced health system and lasts just a few hours, the event may not constitute a “mass gathering” event.

As of March 2020, there have been reports of the suspension of insecticide-treated net (ITN) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) campaigns in several African countries due to concerns around exposure to COVID-19. Suspending such campaigns will leave many vulnerable populations at greater risk of malaria, particularly young children and pregnant women. WHO strongly encourages countries not to suspend the planning for – or implementation of – vector control activities, including ITN and IRS campaigns, while ensuring these services are delivered using best practices to protect health workers and communities from COVID-19 infection. Modifications of planned distribution strategies may be needed to minimize exposure to the coronavirus. WHO commends the leaders of Benin, Chad, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mali, Niger, Sierra Leone and Uganda for committing to move forward with ITN campaigns during the pandemic. Other countries are adapting their net distribution strategies to ensure households receive the nets as quickly and safely as possible.Together with partners, WHO has developed guidance to ensure that those suffering from malaria can safely receive the care they need in COVID-19 settings.  Tailoring malaria interventions in the COVID-19 response includes guidance on the prevention of infection through vector control and chemoprevention, testing, treatment of cases, clinical services, supply chain and laboratory activities. The document is consistent with broader WHO guidance on how to maintain essential health services during the pandemic.

Promote hand washing, respiratory hygiene and social distancing at the event. Make sure you have emergency contact details for all participants, including where they are staying during the event. You should make it clear to them that this information will be shared with the local public health authorities to enable rapid contact tracing if a participant at the event becomes ill with COVID-19. The event organisers need to have an agreed preparedness plan in case one or more participants become ill with COVID-19 symptoms. This should include rapid isolation of the ill person and their safe transfer to a local health facility. You should consider whether the number of participants at the event could be reduced, making available participation by video or teleconference and possibly screening participants for COVID-19 symptoms (cough, fever, malaise) at points of entry to the venue.

For countries not currently known to be experiencing community transmission of COVID-19, the priority consideration will be whether the planned mass gathering event substantially increases the risk of the virus entering the country and becoming established, as well as the risk for participants to importing infection back to their home country and further increasing global spread. In making this assessment, the organizers and their national or local health authorities should recognize that the risk of imported cases of COVID-19 is naturally linked to international travel. They should also recognize that it is neither realistic or desirable to aim for zero risk. When organizers and health authorities are determining whether to hold a mass gathering, they should determine what is an acceptable risk and what additional measures should be implemented to mitigate the risks.For countries where COVID-19 has already started to spread in the community, key consideration will be: aiming at containing or at least slowing down the spread of the virus in the local community/country.preventing participants from other countries being infected with COVID-19  In each case the risk should be considered in the context of the known features of COVID-19, its severity, its transmissibility and the effectiveness of measures to prevent or reduce transmission. The strain already placed on the local health system in responding to COVID-19 outbreak(s), and the additional strain the mass gathering might place on the system also need to be taken into account.You can find more advice on what to look at in the WHO document Key planning recommendations for Mass Gatherings in the context of the current COVID-19 outbreak of 14 February 2020.

No. As each international mass gathering is different, the factors to consider when determining if the event should be cancelled may also differ. Any decision to change a planned international gathering should be based on a careful assessment of the risks and how they can be managed, and the level of event planning. The assessment should involve all stakeholders in the event, and in particular the health authorities in the country or community where the event is due to take place. These authorities and stakeholders are in the best position to assess the level of stress the event might place on the local health system and emergency services – and whether this level of stress is acceptable in the current situation. It is WHO’s view that all countries with community transmission should seriously consider postponing or reducing mass gatherings that bring people together and have the potential to amplify disease and support the recommended best practice of physical distancing. Any decision will be supported through the use of WHO tools, in particular the Risk Assessment for Mass Gatherings during COVID-19. If movement restrictions and further national measures have been established in the country, the WHO RA does not apply. However, when the process of re-opening/conducting mass gatherings is being considered post movement restrictions, it will be key to ensure any decisions are based on a risk assessment, such as the WHO Mass gatherings COVID-19 risk assessment.

Experience from previous disease outbreaks has shown the disruptive effect on health service delivery and the consequences for diseases such as malaria. The 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, for example, undermined malaria control efforts and led to a massive increase in malaria-related illness and death in the 3 countries.A new modelling analysis from WHO and partners, published on 23 April, found that the number of malaria deaths in sub-Saharan Africa could double this year alone if there are severe disruptions in access to insecticide-treated nets and antimalarial medicines due to COVID-19. These projections reinforce the critical importance of sustaining efforts to prevent, detect and treat malaria during the pandemic.In all regions, protective measures should be utilized to minimize the risk of COVID-19 transmission between patients, communities and health providers. WHO and partners have developed guidance on how to safely maintain malaria prevention and treatment services in COVID-19 settings.

"Die in dieser Phase beschlossenen Lockerungen in der Gastronomie sind nur möglich, weil grundlegende Hygieneregelungen und Abstandsregeln gelten, die unbedingt eingehalten werden müssen und die derzeitigen Infektionszahlen eine behutsame Lockerung erlauben. Weitere Lockerungen erfolgen schrittweise in Phasen. Damit geht einher, dass die Lockerung, beispielsweise für Restaurants, in der jetzigen Phase noch nicht für alle Gastronomiebereiche gilt, in denen Menschen zusammenkommen können.
  

    Jede Ausdehnung von Öffnungsmöglichkeiten wird grundsätzlich ganz genau daraufhin überprüft, ob es mit einem Hygienekonzept gelingen kann, die weitere Zurückdrängung des Coronavirus nicht zu gefährden. Das heißt, jede Branche muss dafür ein überzeugendes Konzept vorlegen. In Restaurants können die Vorgaben über eine Tischordnung, Einlass- und Aufenthaltsbeschränkungen, Reservierungsmodalitäten sowie eine Maskenpflicht für die Beschäftigten erfüllt werden. In Bars, Diskotheken und ähnlichen Lokalitäten ist das kaum zu gewährleisten, da der Aufenthalt dort nicht tischgebunden ist, sondern räumlich frei stattfindet. Mindestabstands- und Hygieneregeln können hier viel weniger gewährleistet werden. Auch die Kontaktverfolgung würde dadurch erschwert, dass keine festen Gruppen auf begrenzter Fläche zusammenkommen, sondern die Bewegungsfreiheit auf die ganze Lokalität ausgedehnt ist.

"Der Senat wird in einem schrittweisen Verfahren in mehreren Phasen die Maßnahmen zur Eindämmung des Coronavirus wieder lockern, soweit die Infektionszahlen das zulassen. Dabei ist es besonders wichtig, behutsam vorzugehen, um die Bevölkerung weiterhin vor einer potenziellen zweiten Welle oder einem Neuanstieg an Infizierten insgesamt schützen zu können.
  

    Um die Auswirkung der Lockerungen im Hinblick auf das Infektionsgeschehen zu beurteilen, haben sich der Bund und die Länder auf den Richtwert von 50 Infizierten je 100.000 Einwohner*innen in den Landkreisen oder kreisfreien Städten geeinigt. In Berlin haben wir bekanntermaßen keine Landkreise, es wird auch nicht auf die Bezirke gerechnet, sondern auf die Landeszahlen insgesamt geschaut. Um die Lage der Pandemie für Berlin genau zu beurteilen, und einen etwaigen Handlungsbedarf abzuleiten, hat der Senat dafür ein Ampelsystem entwickelt. Dafür wird sowohl die Reproduktionszahl, die Zahl der Neuinfektionen sowie die Auslastung der Intensivstationsbetten betrachtet.
  


Indikator Reproduktionszahl:
      Die Reproduktionszahl gibt an, wie viele Menschen ein Infizierter ansteckt. Hier ist das Ziel, den Wert dauerhaft unter 1 zu halten. Ein Wert über 1 führt zu einer Infektionsdynamik. Liegt der Wert mindestens an drei Tagen in Folge über 1,1, springt die Ampel auf Gelb. Liegt die Reproduktionszahl mindestens an drei Tagen in Folge bei mindestens 1,2, ist die Stufe Rot erreicht.
    

Indikator Zahl der Neuinfektionen pro Woche:
      Die Zahl von Neuinfektionen hat der Senat wie folgt eingestuft: Die Stufe Rot ist erreicht, wenn sich 30 Personen je 100.000 Einwohner*innen pro Woche neu infiziert haben. Die gelbe Stufe ist erreicht, wenn sich 20 Personen je 100.000 Einwohner*innen pro Woche neu infiziert haben. Die grüne Stufe liegt darunter.
    

Indikator Auslastung der Intensivstationsbetten:
      Wenn der Anteil der für COVID-19-Patient*innen benötigten Plätze auf Intensivstationen mehr als 15% beträgt, wird die Ampel auf Gelb gestellt. Bei einer Auslastung von mehr als 25% der vorhandenen Kapazitäten gilt Rot. Die grüne Stufe liegt unter 15%.
    

Bedeutung Ampelphasen „Gelb“ und „Rot“:
      Wenn zwei der drei o.g. Indikatoren gelb sind, besteht Erörterungsbedarf im Senat und die Vorbereitung möglicher Maßnahmen ist erforderlich. Sind zwei von drei oben genannten Indikatoren rot, erfordert dies die Umsetzung von Maßnahmen bzw. die Rücknahme von Lockerungen."

All of the considerations described above apply to malaria-eliminating countries and those preventing re-establishment of the disease: efforts must be sustained to prevent, detect and treat malaria cases while preventing the spread of COVID-19 and ensuring the safety of those who deliver the services. Countries that are nearing malaria elimination must protect their important gains and avoid malaria resurgences. Countries that have eliminated malaria must remain vigilant for any imported cases of malaria that may be occurring to prevent reintroduction of the disease.

In addition to routine approaches to malaria control, there may be a case for special measures in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic – such as a temporary return to presumptive malaria treatment, or the use of mass drug administration – which have proved useful in some previous emergencies. Presumptive malaria treatment refers to treatment of a suspected malaria case without the benefit of diagnostic confirmation (e.g. through a rapid diagnostic test). This approach is typically reserved for extreme circumstances, such as disease in settings where prompt diagnosis is no longer possible.Mass drug administration (MDA) is a WHO-recommended approach for rapidly reducing malaria mortality and morbidity during epidemics and in complex emergency settings. Through MDA, all individuals in a targeted population are given antimalarial medicines – often at repeated intervals – regardless of whether or not they show symptoms of the disease. Such special measures should only be adopted after careful consideration of 2 key aims: lowering malaria-related mortality and keeping health workers and communities safe. WHO is exploring concrete proposals for when and how to activate such measures; guidance will be published in due course.

Chlorine solutions are strongly discouraged as they carry a higher risk of hand irritation and ill health effects from making and diluting chlorine solutions, including eye irritation and respiratory problems. In addition, there is a risk of loss of antimicrobial effect if exposed to sunlight or heat.  Preparing chlorine solutions requires training to reach the correct dose of 0.05% with varying strengths of bleach available in the private sector.  Even if stored at a cool dry place with a lid away from sunlight, they have to be renewed daily.  In comparison simple soapy water solution do not have any of the above-mentioned health risks and complications including loss of antiviral effect due to heat or sunlight.  The antiviral effect of soapy water is due to the oily surface membrane of the COVID-virus that is dissolved by soap, killing the virus.

Violence against women is a grave violation of women’s human rights, no matter when, where, or how it takes place. There are many forms of violence against women, which have many potential negative health consequences for women and their children.  Violence against women can result in injuries and serious physical, mental, sexual and reproductive health problems, including sexually transmitted infections, HIV, and unplanned pregnancies. In extreme cases, violence against women can result in death. The effects of violence are very often long-lived. Violence – in all its forms – can have an impact on a woman’s well-being throughout the rest of her life. This is unacceptable, and the risks of violence that women and their children face during the current COVID-19 crisis cannot be ignored. When we are able to prevent violence, or to support women survivors of violence, we help to safeguard women’s human rights, and promote physical and mental health and well-being for women throughout their lives. This also helps to alleviate pressure on already stretched essential public services, including the health system.

Regular physical activity benefits both the body and
mind. It can reduce high blood pressure, help manage weight and reduce the risk
of heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and various cancers. It also
improves bone and muscle strength and increases balance, flexibility and
fitness. For older people, activities that improve balance help to prevent
falls and injuries. For children, regular physical activity helps support
healthy growth and development and reduce the risk of disease in later life,
and through regular activity, children can develop fundamental movement skills
and build social relationships.Regular physical activity also improves mental health
and can reduce the risk of depression, cognitive decline and delay the onset of
dementia - and improve overall feelings of wellbeing."

"All modern methods of contraception help to prevent pregnancy. Women and their partners can choose any modern contraceptive method that is acceptable to and safe for them. The best method of contraception is the one that works well for you.
There is a wide variety of modern methods, one of which may suit you best. For more information see here. 
Condoms, when they are used consistently and correctly, are the only method of contraception that help to prevent unintended pregnancy and protect against sexually transmitted infections, including HIV.  They can be used together with other methods of contraception to protect against both unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.
Emergency contraceptive pills can prevent up to 95% of pregnancies when taken within 5 days after intercourse, and they can be taken by anyone with or without a health condition"

"Yes. It may be difficult however, to access all the methods of contraception that are normally available in your country due to restrictions on movement, lack of supply, as well as increased demands on health providers and services.  


If you have a pre-existing health condition, consult a provider to find out what options suit you best, and which are available and feasible. Seek advice and information from your health provider and consider using methods that do not have medical restrictions like minipills, condoms, fertility awareness-based methods, diaphragm, spermicides or lactational amenorrhea if you are exclusively breastfeeding."

Contraception and family planning information and services are life-saving and important at all times. Sexual activity does not cease with the COVID-19 pandemic, it is therefore crucial to ensure that people are able to access rights-based services and information to initiate and / or continue use of contraception. By preventing unintended pregnancies, contraception helps to protect girls and women from the negative health consequences of unintended pregnancies, which can save their lives. Contraception reduces the need for abortion, meaning that women and girls are less at risk of unsafe abortion, which again can be lifesaving.  Condoms, when used consistently and correctly, help to prevent both unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections (including HIV).  In addition, by preventing the negative health consequences associated with unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortion and sexually transmitted infections (including HIV), contraception can help alleviate unnecessary additional pressure on already-stretched health systems which are working hard to address COVID-19.

"Plan and develop innovative strategies to ensure as many eligible people as possible can access information and contraception during this period. 


Increase use of mobile phones and digital technologies to help people make decisions about which contraceptive methods to use, and how they can be accessed.  


Enable health care workers to provide contraceptive information and services as per national guidelines to the full extent possible.  This is particularly important where pregnancy poses a high risk to health.   


Expand availability of contraceptive services (including both information and methods) through places other than healthcare facilities, such as pharmacies, drug shops, online platforms and other outlets.  This can be with or without prescription depending on national guidelines and contraceptive method.   


Relax restrictions on the number of repeat issues of prescription-only hormonal contraceptives that can be issued. 


Ensure access to emergency post-coital contraception, including consideration of over the counter provision. 


Enable access to contraception for women and girls in the immediate post-partum and post abortion periods when they may access health services."

All individuals dealing with soiled bedding, towels and clothes from patients with COVID-19 should: Wear appropriate personal protective equipment, which includes heavy duty gloves, mask, eye protection (face shield/goggles), long-sleeved gown, apron (if gown is not fluid resistant), boots or closed shoes before touching any soiled linen.Never carry soiled linen against body; place soiled linen in a clearly labelled, leak-proof container (e.g. bag, bucket)If there is any solid excrement on the linen, such as feces or vomit, scrape it off carefully with a flat, firm object and put it in the commode or designated toilet/latrine before putting linen in the designated container. If the latrine is not in the same room as the patient, place soiled excrement in covered bucket to dispose of in the toilet or latrine; Wash and disinfect linen: washing by machine with warm water (60-90°C) and laundry detergent is recommended for cleaning and disinfection of linens. If machine washing is not possible, linen can be soaked in hot water and soap in a large drum, using a stick to stir, avoiding splashing. If hot water not available, soak linen in 0.05% chlorine for approximately 30 minutes.  Finally, rinse with clean water and let linen dry fully in the sunlight.

Physical activity includes all forms of active
recreation, sports participation, cycling and walking, as well as activities
you do at work and around the home and garden. It doesn’t have to be exercise
or sport – play, dance, gardening, and even house cleaning and carrying heavy
shopping is all part of being physically active.During the COVID-19 pandemic, when so many of us are
very restricted in our movements, it is even more important for people of all
ages and abilities to be as active as possible. Even a short break from
sitting, by doing 3-5 minutes of physical movement, such as walking or
stretching, will help ease muscle strain, relieve mental tension and improve
blood circulation and muscle activity. Regular physical activity can also help

Health care workers collecting NP and OP swab specimens from suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients should be well-trained on the procedure and should wear a clean, non-sterile, long-sleeve gown, a medical mask, eye protection (i.e., googles or face shield), and gloves. Procedure should be conducted in a separate/isolation room, and during NP specimen collection health care workers should request the patients to cover their mouth with a medical mask or tissue. Although collection of NP and OP swabs have the potential to induce fits of coughing from the patient undergoing the procedure, there is no currently available evidence that cough generated via NP/OP specimen collection leads to increased risk of COVID-19 transmission via aerosols.

WHO developed its rapid guidance based on the consensus of international experts who considered the currently available evidence on the modes of transmission of 2019-nCoV. This evidence demonstrates viral transmission by droplets and contact with contaminated surfaces of equipment; it does not support routine airborne transmission. Airborne transmission may happen, as has been shown with other viral respiratory diseases, during aerosol-generating procedures (e.g., tracheal intubation, bronchoscopy), thus WHO recommends airborne precautions for these procedures.

"No. WHO does not recommend that asymptomatic individuals (i.e., who do not have respiratory symptoms) in the community should wear medical masks, as currently there is no evidence that routine use of medical masks by healthy individuals prevents 2019-nCoV transmission. Masks are recommended to be used by symptomatic persons in the community. Misuse and overuse of medical masks may cause serious issues of shortage of stocks and lack of mask availability for those who actually need to wear them. 
In health care facilities where health care workers are directly taking care of suspect or confirmed 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease patients, masks are an important part of containing 2019-nCoV spread between people, along with other PPE and hand hygiene.

Ideally, suspected and confirmed 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease patients should be isolated in single rooms. However, when this is not feasible (e.g., limited number of single rooms), cohorting is an acceptable option. Some patients with suspected 2019-nCoV infection may actually have other respiratory illnesses, hence they must be cohorted separately from patients with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection.

There is currently no known difference between the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 or risk of severe illness or foetal compromise for pregnant and non-pregnant women or adults of reproductive age.  Pregnant and recently pregnant women with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be treated with supportive and management therapies, considering the immunologic and physiologic adaptations during and after pregnancy which may overlap with COVID-19 symptoms.  Data are limited but, until the evidence base provides clearer information, special consideration should be given to pregnant women with concomitant medical illnesses who could be infected with COVID-19. There are no reported deaths in pregnant women at time of publishing this information[17] however, COVID-19 testing of symptomatic pregnant women may need to be prioritized to enable access to specialized care.  All recently pregnant women with COVID-19 or who have recovered from COVID-19 should be provided with information and counselling on safe infant feeding and appropriate IPC measures to prevent COVID-19 virus transmission[18].With confirmed disease or under investigation, management is similar to non-pregnant women, with appropriate isolation of confirmed or under investigation.  Obstetric facilities must be notified and prepared, noting that each infant born to any mother with confirmed COVID-19 should be considered a ‘person under investigation’ and should be isolated according to the IPC guidance.  Currently, it is unknown whether newborns with COVID-19 are at increased risk for severe complications.

	Maggiore è il valore di R0 e più elevato è il rischio di diffusione del virus.
	Se R0 è minore di 1 (cioè ogni infettato contagia meno di una persona), significa che l’infezione tenderà a estinguersi naturalmente perché diminuirà progressivamente il numero dei contagiati.


Rt (si legge R con t) è l'espressione dello stesso indice in un dato momento dell’epidemia in funzione delle misure di contenimento adottate.
	Quanto più Rt sarà vicino a zero, tanto più rapida sarà l'eliminazione dell’infezione nella popolazione.

Do not exercise if you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing. Stay home and rest, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.If you are able to go for a walk or bicycle ride always practice physical distancing and wash your hands with water and soap before you leave, when you get to where you are going, and as soon as you get home.  If water and soap are not immediately available, use alcohol-based hand rub. If you go to a park or public open space to walk, run or exercise always practice physical distancing and wash your hands with water and soap, before you leave, when you get to where you are going, and as soon as you get home.  If water and soap are not immediately available, use alcohol-based hand rub. Follow the directions of your local health authority in regards to any restrictions on the number of people with you and/or restrictions on the use of public outdoor play or exercise equipment. If you are not regularly active start slowly and with low intensity activities, like walking and low impact exercises. Start with shorter amounts, like 5-10 minutes, and gradually build up to 30 minutes or more continuously over a few weeks. It is better and safer to be active for short periods more frequently than to try and be active for long periods when you are not used to it. Choose the right activity so that you reduce the risk of injury and that you enjoy the activity. Choose the right intensity according to your health status and fitness level. You should be able to breath comfortably and hold a conversation while you do light- and moderate-intensity physical activity.

"WHO has detailed recommendations on the amount of physical activity people of all ages should do to benefit their health and wellbeing. (available here for children under age of 5 and here for youth, adults and olders) Here are the minimum levels we recommend:Infants under the age of 1 year need to be physically active several times a day.
    Children under 5 years of age should spend at least 180 minutes a day in physical activities, with 3-4 year-olds being moderately or vigorously active for an hour a day.
    Children and adolescents aged 5-17yearsall children and adolescents should do at least 60 minutes a day of moderate to vigorous-intensity physical activity, including activities that strengthen muscle and bone, at least 3 days per week.Adults aged over 18 years should do a total of at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity throughout the week, or at least 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity throughout the week, including muscle-strengthening activities 2 or more days per
        week.
    older adults with poor mobility should do physical activity to enhance balance and prevent falls on 3 or more days per week.
      But any physical activity is better than none.  Start with small amounts and gradually increase duration, frequency and intensity over time. Being active during the COVID-19 pandemic is challenging for us all.  Because the opportunities to be physically active seem to be more restricted, it is even more important to plan in every day the ways to be active and to reduce the time spent
    sitting for long periods. Put simply, it is a critical time to ensure we all move more and sit less."

There are few data on the clinical presentation of COVID-19 in specific populations, such as children and pregnant women[13] but findings from a small published study suggest that there is currently no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy[14].  Although no vertical transmission has been documented, transmission after birth via contact with infectious respiratory secretions is a concern. Infants born to mothers with suspected, probable, or confirmed COVID-19 should be fed according to standard infant feeding guidelines[15], while applying necessary precautions for infection prevention and control (IPC).  As with all confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases, symptomatic mothers who are breastfeeding or practicing skin-to-skin contact or kangaroo mother care should practice respiratory hygiene, including during feeding (for example, use of a medical mask when near a child if the mother has respiratory symptoms), perform hand hygiene before and after contact with the child, and routinely clean and disinfect surfaces with which the symptomatic mother has been in contact[16].   Q&A on COVID-19, pregnancy, childbirth and breastfeeding

It is important to assure continuous access to essential HIV prevention, testing and treatment services also where measurements of confinement are implemented within the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic. While access to essential services should be maintained, adapted and evidence-based measures to reduce possible transmission should be considered and implemented.  These include[12]: Applying standard precautions for all patients (including ensuring that all patients cover their nose and mouth with a tissue or elbow when coughing or sneezing, offering a medical mask to patients with suspected COVID-19 infection while they are in waiting in the service, perform hand hygiene etc.) Health care and outreach      workers, as well as peer educators and clients should apply adapted hand      hygiene measuresEnsuring triage, early      recognition, and source control (isolating patients with suspected      COVID-19 infection)Ensure there is adequate      ventilation in all areas in the healthcare facilitySpatial separation of at least      1 metre should ideally be maintained between all patients within all types      of servicesCleaning and disinfection      procedures should be followed consistently and correctlyDispensing medicines (for treatment of HIV, TB and      other chronic conditions such as opioid dependence) for longer periods      allowing reduced frequency of patient visits Consider reduction of services to the most critical      ones (provision of essential treatment and prevention services; services      such as counselling sessions may be reduced or adapted)Generally, vulnerable populations, including members of key populations, as well as homeless and/or displaced people may be at increased risk of infection – because of additional comorbidities impacting on their immune system, reduced ability to apply measures of confinement and social distancing, as well as generally limited access to health services.  It is critical that services that reach these populations such as community-based services, drop-in centres and outreach services can continue providing life-saving prevention (distribution of condoms, needles and syringes), testing and treatment while securing safety of staff and clients. Services can be adapted according to above considerations where applicable.

"The coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causing COVID-19 is mainly transmitted between people via respiratory droplets or secretions from the respiratory tract. Transmission via droplets happens when an infected person coughs or sneezes and the droplets reach mucous tissue in someone's eyes, nose, or mouth. The droplets fall to the ground within approximately one meter (3 ft) from the source.
The virus can also be transmitted via contaminated surfaces, so-called indirect contact transmission. Therefore, it cannot be excluded that the disease can spread via items. It is currently not clear how long the virus can survive on surfaces and items. The material itself and conditions in the surrounding such as humidity, temperature, and sunlight will determine how long the virus is viable. Further studies will clarify the importance of transmission via surfaces and items for the overall spreading of COVID-19.
You can decrease the risk of transmission by keeping a distance from other people in public spaces, washing your hands often with soap and warm water, avoiding touching your face (eyes, nose and mouth), and by staying at home if you are ill."

"There are few studies of pregnant women with COVID-19, and only a limited amount of information is available. At present, there are no indications that pregnancy is a risk factor for severe illness from COVID-19.
Risk factors such as severe obesity, high blood pressure or diabetes might increase the risk for severe illness. Therefore, pregnant women who have any of those risk factors should be careful and consult with their midwife or doctor and limit close contact with people outside of the household as much as possible.
It is important to avoid getting infected before delivery because a respiratory infection towards the end of the pregnancy can be difficult and might imply risks to the pregnant woman.
At present, there is only limited information about COVID-19 and pregnancy. We recommend that pregnant women take the same precautions as against all infectious diseases.

Patients with severe illness have breathing difficulties (shortness of breath and low oxygenation of the blood). Some of these patients need intensive care in a hospital, for example in a ventilator. The severe symptoms usually appear around one week after falling ill.

The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, and tiredness. Other symptoms that are less common and may affect some patients include aches and pains, nasal congestion, headache, conjunctivitis, sore throat, diarrhea, loss of taste or smell or a rash on skin or discoloration of fingers or toes. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but only have very mild symptoms. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing hospital treatment. Around 1 out of every 5 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart and lung problems, diabetes, or cancer, are at higher risk of developing serious illness.  However, anyone can catch COVID-19 and become seriously ill.  People of all ages who experience fever and/or  cough associated withdifficulty breathing/shortness of breath, chest pain/pressure, or loss of speech or movement should seek medical attention immediately. If possible, it is recommended to call the health care provider or facility first, so the patient can be directed to the right clinic.

"There are reports of an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 among certain groups of people. Since the virus is new, we have limited knowledge about which groups might run a higher risk of developing severe illness. Available data from studies of COVID-19 indicate that old age is the most prominent risk factor. Therefore, people over the age of 70 is the main group at risk for severe illness.
Older people with pre-existing medical conditions such as high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, or diabetes are over-represented among the severe cases of COVID-19. People with several pre-existing conditions are at a particularly high risk.
There is a possibility that people with illnesses or medical treatment affecting the immune system run a higher risk of developing severe illness. If you have a condition that makes you vulnerable to severe forms of respiratory tract infections, even if you are younger than 70 years, you should seek advice from your doctor about how to handle your condition and how to reduce the risks associated with COVID-19."

"All mothers in affected and at-risk areas who have symptoms of fever, cough or difficulty breathing, should seek medical care early, and follow instructions from a health care provider.  Considering the benefits of breastfeeding and the insignificant role of breastmilk in the transmission of other respiratory viruses, the mother can continue breastfeeding, while applying all the necessary precautions. Transmission of active COVID-19 (virus that can cause infection) through breast milk and breastfeeding has not been detected to date. There is no reason to avoid or stop breastfeeding. Breastfeeding boosts the child’s immune system, and the mother’s antibodies are passed on to the child
through breast milk, helping the child fight infections. For symptomatic mothers well enough to breastfeed, this includes wearing a mask when near a child (including during feeding), washing hands before and after contact with the child (including feeding), and cleaning/disinfecting surfaces they have touched – as should be done in all cases where anyone with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 interacts with others, including children.   If a mother is too ill, she should be encouraged to express milk and give it to the child via a clean cup and/or spoon – all while following the same infection prevention methods."

D. h. in diesen Fällen wird der Arbeitnehmer von der Pflicht der Leistungserbringung frei; es ist nicht zwingend erforderlich, Urlaub zu nehmen.
Zu beachten ist jedoch, dass bei einem Leistungsverweigerungsrecht des Arbeitnehmers aus persönlichen Verhinderungsgründen nur unter engen Voraussetzungen ein Anspruch auf Fortzahlung des Arbeitsentgelts bestehen kann. Ein solcher Entgeltanspruch kann sich aus § 616 BGB für eine verhältnismäßig nicht erhebliche Zeit ergeben.

"The Public Health Agency does not currently consider it necessary to close all schools in Sweden. There are no scientific evidence indicating that such an intervention would have any significant impact on the pandemic, nor has any major transmission of COVID-19 in schools been reported.
Closing schools and pre-schools would have a negative impact on society. For example, essential workers to the public (e.g. healthcare staff) would need to stay at home with their children. It could also put vulnerable groups, such as grandparents, at risk if they help out with childcare.
School is also a place of safety and stability for many children. Before closing a school, there must be plans made for alternative places where the children should go instead. However, it is of utmost importance that staff and children who have any symptoms of illness stay at home.
The Swedish parliament has passed a bill (2020:148) allowing temporary closure of schools and pre-schools due to extraordinary events, making it possible for the Government or the head of a school to close schools under particular circumstances. There is also a regulation (2020:115) regarding the provision of education for pupils during a school closure."

"Currently, there is not enough evidence for or against the use of masks (medical or other) in healthy individuals in the wider community. However, WHO is actively studying the rapidly evolving science on masks and continuously updates its guidance. Medical masks are recommended primarily in health care settings, but can be considered in other circumstances (see below). Medical masks should be combined with other key infection prevention and control measures such as hand hygiene and physical distancing. 
Healthcare workers
Why? Medical masks and respirators such as N95, FFP2 or equivalent are recommended for and should be reserved for, healthcare workers while giving care to patients. Close contact with people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and their surrounding environment are the main routes of transmission, which means healthcare workers are the most exposed. People who are sick and exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19
Why? Anyone who is sick, with mild symptoms such as muscle aches, slight cough, sore throat or fatigue, should isolate at home and use a medical mask according to WHO’s recommendation on home care of patients with suspected COVID-19. Coughing, sneezing or talking can generate droplets that cause can spread the infection. These droplets can reach the face of others nearby and land on the surrounding environment. If an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks while wearing a medical mask, this can help to protect those nearby from infection.
If a sick person needs to go to a health facility they should wear a medical mask. 
Anyone taking care of a person at home who is sick with COVID-19 
Why? Those caring for individuals who are sick with COVID-19 should wear a medical mask for protection. Again, close, frequent and prolonged contact with someone with COVID-19 puts caretakers at high risk. 
National decision makers may also choose to recommend medical mask use for certain individuals using a risk-based approach. This approach takes into consideration the purpose of the mask, risk of exposure and vulnerability of the wearer, the setting, the feasibility of use and the types of masks to be considered."

Pinch the metal strip or stiff edge of the mask so it moulds to the shape of your nose.Pull down the mask’s bottom so it covers your mouth and your chin.Do not touch the mask while you are wearing it for protection.After use, take off the mask with clean hands; remove the elastic loops from behind the ears while keeping the mask away from your face and clothes, to avoid touching potentially contaminated surfaces of the mask. Discard the mask in a closed bin immediately after use. Do not reuse the mask.Perform hand hygiene after touching or discarding the mask – Use alcohol-based hand rub or, if visibly soiled, wash your hands with soap and water.Be aware that there is a global shortage of medical masks (both surgical masks and N95 masks). These should be reserved as much as possible for health care workers. Remember that  masks are not a substitute for other, more effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 such as frequently washing your hands, covering your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter from others. See basic protective measures against the new coronavirus for more information.Follow the advice of your national health authority on the use of masks.

Wearing a medical mask can limit the spread of certain respiratory
    viral diseases, including COVID-19. However, the use of a mask alone is not sufficient to provide an adequate level of protection. Other measures such as physical distancing and hand hygiene should be adopted.
WHO aims to provide the most scientifically sound yet practical recommendations for the safety and wellbeing of individuals in all settings.

"For countries that are currently considering the use of masks, WHO advises decision makers to apply a risk-based approach and consider the following:
Purpose of mask use: if the intention is preventing the wearer transmitting infection to others (that is source control) or to offer protection to the wearer against infection (that is prevention).
Risk of exposure to COVID-19 due to epidemiology/number of cases in the population: if there is high community transmission and other measures such as contact tracing or ability to carry out testing are not possible. 
depending on occupation: e.g., individuals working in close contact with public (e.g., community health worker, cashier).
Vulnerability of the mask wearer/population: for example, if supplies are adequate medical masks could be used by people with comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus, older people, immunocompromised patients.
Setting in which the population lives: settings with high population density (e.g. refugee camps, those living in cramped conditions) and settings where individuals are unable to keep a safe distance (e.g. crowded buses or other transport).
Feasibility: availability and costs of masks, access to clean water to wash non-medical  masks, and ability of mask wearers to tolerate adverse effects of wearing a mask. Type of mask: medical mask versus non-medical mask (prioritization of medical masks for health care providers, symptomatic people and their caregivers).
In addition to these factors, potential advantages of the use of masks by healthy people in the community setting include reducing potential exposure risk from an infected person during the ‘pre-symptomatic’ period or if an infected person is asymptomatic. 
There are potential risks and disadvantages that should be taken into account in any decision-making process on the use of masks:
Non-medical or cloth masks could increase potential for COVID-19 to infect a person if the mask is contaminated by dirty hands and touched often, or kept on other parts of the face or head and then placed back over the mouth and nose
Depending on the type of mask used, could cause difficulty in breathing They can lead to facial skin breakdown
They can lead to difficulty with communicating clearly They can be uncomfortable to wear It is possible that mask use, with unclear benefits, could create a false sense of security in the wearer, leading to diminished practice of recognized beneficial preventive measures such as physical distancing and hand hygiene."

"Non-medical masks are often homemade of breathable fabrics and can be commercially available as well.   There are numerous designs for fabric masks, but they generally cover the nose and mouth, are secured with ties or elastic loops, include multiple layers of fabric, and can sometimes be washed and re-used. 
The evidence about the benefits of these masks is limited. One good quality study showed that the risk of respiratory infection is increased (and not reduced) in health care workers using cotton cloth masks when compared to medical masks. Cloth masks are currently being recommended by some countries as a means of source control in the general population. Although their protective effectiveness to the wearer is unknown, they may protect others if the wearer is a pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic carrier.
WHO is continuing to gather and review data as new studies become available and will update guidance accordingly."

"No, WHO does not recommend the regular use of gloves by people in the community. The wearing of gloves may increase risks, since it can lead to self-infection or transmission to others through touching contaminated surfaces which is not followed by removal of gloves and hand hygiene. 
Therefore, in public places such as supermarkets, in addition to physical distancing, WHO recommends the installation of public hand hygiene stations at the entrance and exit.
By widely improving hand hygiene practices, countries can help prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus."

"Medical masks (also known as surgical masks): these are made from a minimum of three layers of synthetic nonwoven materials, and configured to have filtration layers sandwiched in the middle. These masks are available in different thicknesses, have various levels of fluid-resistance and two levels of filtration. These medical masks reduce the transfer of saliva or respiratory droplets from the wearer to others and to the environment. They also decrease the likelihood of potentially infectious droplets from others reaching the mouth and nose of the mask wearer. Hand hygiene should be performed before putting on a clean mask and after removing the mask. These masks should be worn tightly around the chin and top of the nose. The wearer should avoid touching the mask while it is on the face and the mask should be immediately discarded if it becomes moist. Importantly, wearing a mask must be combined with other preventive measures including performing frequent and appropriate hand hygiene and physical distancing of at least 1 metre (3 feet).
Respirators (also known as filtering facepiece respirators --FFR) and available at different performance levels such as FFP2, FFP3, N95, N99): these are specifically designed for healthcare workers who provide care to COVID-19 patients in settings and areas where special medical procedures are undertaken.   Respirators are intended to protect the wearer when these medical procedures aerosolize smaller particles than normal droplets into the air in the health treatment area.  Healthcare workers should be fit tested before using a respirator to ensure that the respirator is sealed tightly on the wearer’s face and is properly fitted. Respirators with valves should not be used as the purpose of source control."

People living with HIV with advanced disease, those with low CD4 and high viral load and those who are not taking antiretroviral treatment have an increased risk of infections and related complications in general.  It is unknown if the immunosuppression of HIV will put a person at greater risk for COVID-19, thus, until more is known, additional precautions for all people with advanced HIV or poorly controlled HIV, should be employed[1],[2].At present there is no evidence that the risk of infection or complications of COVID-19 is different among people living with HIV who are clinically and immunologically stable on antiretroviral treatment when compared with the general population.  Some people living with HIV may have known risk factors for COVID-19 complications, such as diabetes, hypertension and other noncommunicable diseases and as such may have increased risk of COVID-19 unrelated to HIV.  We know that during the SARS and MERS outbreaks there were only a few case reports of mild disease among people living with HIV.  To date, there is a case report of a person living with HIV who had COVID-19 and recovered[3] and a small study on risk factors and antiretrovirals used among people living with HIV with COVID-19 from China.  This study reported similar rates of COVID-19 disease as compared to the entire population and increased risk with older age, but not with low CD4, high viral load level or antiretroviral regimen[4]. Current clinical data suggest the main mortality risk factors are linked to older age and other comorbidities including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and hypertension. Some very healthy people have also developed severe disease from the coronavirus infection[5].  PLHIV are advised to take the same precautions as the general population[6],[7]: wash hands oftencough etiquette physical distancingseek medical care if symptomaticself-isolation if in contact with someone with COVID-19 and other actions per the government response   People living with HIV who are taking antiretroviral drugs should ensure that they have at least 30 days and up to 6-month supply of medicines and ensure that their vaccinations are up to date (influenza and pneumococcal vaccines). Adequate supplies of medicines to treat co-infections and comorbidities and addiction should also be ensured.

Several studies have suggested that patients infected with the virus causing COVID-19, and the related coronavirus infections (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) had good clinical outcomes, with almost all cases recovering fully.  In some cases, patients were given an antiretroviral drug: lopinavir boosted with ritonavir (LPV/r). These studies were mostly carried out in HIV-negative individuals.It is important to note that these studies using LPV/r had important limitations. The studies were small, timing, duration and dosing for treatment were varied and most patients received co-interventions/co-treatments which may have contributed to the reported outcomes. While the evidence of benefit of using antiretrovirals to treat coronavirus infections is of very low certainty, serious side effects were rare. Among people living with HIV, the routine use of LPV/r as treatment for HIV is associated with several side effects of moderate severity. However, as the duration of treatment in patients with coronavirus infections was generally limited to a few weeks, these occurrences can be expected to be low or less than that reported from routine use.

Two studies have reported the use of LPV/r as post-exposure prophylaxis for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. One of these studies suggested that the occurrence of MERS-CoV infection was lower among health workers receiving LPV/r compared to those who did not receive any drugs; the other study found no cases of SARS-CoV infection among 19 people living with HIV hospitalized in the same ward of SARS patients, of whom 11 were on antiretroviral therapy. Again, the certainty of the evidence is very low due to small sample size, variability in drugs provided, and uncertainty regarding intensity of exposure.

Antiretrovirals are an efficacious and highly tolerable treatment for people living with HIV. The antiretroviral LPV/r is currently being investigated as a possible treatment for COVID-19.If they are to be used for the treatment of COVID-19, a plan should be in place to ensure there is adequate and continuous supply to cover the needs of all people living with HIV already using LPV/r and those who will need to begin treatment. However, a relatively small proportion of people are on regimens which include LPV/r, since it is used as a second-line regimen according to WHO’s HIV treatment guidelines. Any country that allows the use of HIV medicines for the treatment of COVID-19 must ensure that an adequate and sustainable supply is in place.

As the world scales up public health responses to the COVID19 pandemic, countries are being urged to take decisive action to control the epidemic. WHO has urged all countries to ensure an appropriate balance between protecting health, preventing economic and social disruption, and respecting human rights.  WHO is working with partners including the UNAIDS Joint Programme and the Global Network of People Living with HIV to ensure that human rights are not eroded in the response to COVID-19 and to ensure that people living with or affected by HIV are offered the same access to services as others and to ensure HIV-related services continue without disruption.To mitigate potential prison outbreaks of COVID19 and reduce morbidity and mortality among people in prisons and other closed settings, it is crucial that prisons and immigration detention centres are embedded within the broader public health response. This requires close collaboration between health and justice ministries and includes protocols for entry screening, personal protection measures, physical distancing, environmental cleaning and disinfection, and restriction of movement, including limitation of transfers and access for non-essential staff and visitors.  In the current context it is of critical importance that countries work toward developing non-custodial strategies to prevent overcrowding in closed settings[10]. Governance of prison health by a ministry of health, rather than a ministry of justice or similar, is likely to facilitate this[11].

"Medical masks are recommended in health care settings. However, it is important to remember that the use of masks should be combined with other key infection prevention and control measures such as hand hygiene and physical distancing, as they do not serve all purposes to protect against COVID-19. WHO recommends the use of medical masks for the following individuals:
Healthcare workers
Why? Medical masks and respirators such as N95, FFP2 or equivalent are recommended for and should be reserved for, healthcare workers while giving care to patients. Healthcare workers are the most exposed because they are in close contact with people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and their surrounding environment, which are the main routes of transmission. 
People who are sick and exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19
Why? Anyone who is sick, even with mild symptoms such as muscle aches, slight cough, sore throat or fatigue, should isolate at home and use a medical mask as much as possible according to WHO’s recommendation on home care of patients with suspected COVID-19. Coughing, sneezing or talking can generate droplets that can spread the infection. These droplets can reach the face of others nearby or land on the surrounding environment. If an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks wearing a medical mask, this helps to protect those nearby from infection.
Anyone taking care of a person at home who is sick with COVID-19 
Why? Those caring for individuals who are sick with COVID-19 should wear a medical mask for protection. Close and frequent contact with someone with COVID-19 can put those caring for them at high risk. 
National decision makers may also choose to recommend medical mask use for certain individuals using a risk-based approach. This approach takes into consideration the purpose of the mask, risk of exposure and vulnerability of the wearer, the setting and feasibility of use and the types of masks considered. See “Advice on the use of masks in the context of COVID-19”.WHO will continue to update guidance according to scientific findings."

"It is not yet clear how long the virus can survive outside the body. Research on related coronaviruses shows that they can live for several days on surfaces and items, under particular conditions. Their survival depends on temperature, humidity, and sunlight. Coronaviruses are sensitive to dehydration.
The amount of virus particles present also determines how long a surface or an item is contagious. Such studies are done under controlled conditions in laboratories, and are not directly transferable to other environments, for example in the community.
A recent study from a healthcare setting where patients with COVID-19 had been isolated shows that small amounts of genetic material from the virus can remain in the environment. Further studies will clarify the role of indirect contact transmission for the spreading of COVID-19.
It is important to maintain good hand hygiene. By washing your hands with soap and water you can decrease the risk of getting infected and infecting others. If water and soap are not available, alcohol-based hand rub can be used instead."

"So-called serological tests are being developed. They detect antibodies in the blood and can be used in order to find out if a person has had an infection with the new coronavirus. There are no reliable tests of this kind available yet. When they become available, they will primarily be used for testing healthcare and social care staff.
Serological tests are not useful during the acute illness, since they only, after some time of infection, detect whether someone has, or has had COVID-19."

"To avoid getting infected the Public Health Agency urges anyone 70 or older to limit their contacts with other people.
You should not travel by public transport, e.g. train, bus, tram or subway, visit supermarkets or other venues where many people gather at the same time. Instead, ask friends, family or neighbours to do your shopping, pick up medicines from the pharmacy, or run other errands.
Many people feel worried, insecure and lonely under these circumstances. Remember that this situation will only remain for a limited time.

"The Public Health Agency uses several different surveillance systems to monitor the spread of COVID-19 in Sweden. Since COVID-19 is subject to mandatory reporting under the Communicable Diseases Act, physicians and laboratories continuously supply data to be analyzed by the Public Health Agency on a daily basis.
Other sources of data are random samples from patients with symptoms of influenza, or from other groups of people. Statistics from the medical advice service 1177 (web searches and telephone calls) is also used to monitor the situation.
Collected data provides a background for decisions about interventions made with the aim of minimising mortality, the number of people affected by the disease, and the negative effects for society. Data from surveillance also makes it possible to monitor and evaluate the effects of interventions so far, and to follow and somewhat predict the further development of the pandemic.
The Public Health Agency issues a weekly report showing the number of COVID-19 cases, beginning 20 March 2020.
Weekly reports and other information about surveillance can be found here (in Swedish)."

Grundsätzlich sind Arbeitnehmer verpflichtet, die arbeitsvertraglich geschuldeten Arbeitsleistungen, wozu auch Dienstreisen und dienstliche Veranstaltungen zählen, zu erbringen. Allerdings kann ein Leistungsverweigerungsrecht bestehen, wenn dem Arbeitnehmer die Erbringung seiner Arbeitsleistung unzumutbar ist (§ 275 Abs. 3 BGB). Eine Unzumutbarkeit ist z. B. dann gegeben, wenn die Arbeit für den Betroffenen eine erhebliche objektive Gefahr oder zumindest einen ernsthaften objektiv begründeten Verdacht der Gefährdung für Leib oder Gesundheit darstellt. Dies ist im Einzelfall zu entscheiden. Die bloße Befürchtung, man könne sich mit dem Coronavirus infizieren, dürfte ohne weitere objektiv begründete Anhaltspunkte nicht ausreichen, um die Teilnahme an einer Dienstreise oder sonstigen dienstlichen Veranstaltungen zu verweigern.

Diesen Nachweis muss der Hersteller in vorklinischen Untersuchungen und klinischen Prüfungen erbringen. Der Impfstoff wird zunächst an Tieren und anschließend in einem mehrstufigen Verfahren an freiwilligen Probanden im Rahmen von klinischen Prüfungen getestet. Verlaufen diese Prüfungen erfolgreich, kann ein Zulassungsverfahren beginnen. Ist dieses erfolgreich abgeschlossen, kann der Impfstoff in die Massenproduktion gelangen und vermarktet werden.

Although the new coronavirus weakens and dies over time outside of the human body, studies suggest that it can live on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days, depending on surface, temperature and other environmental factors. For instance, a small amount of the new coronavirus is still detectable on plastic surfaces for up to three days, on stainless steel for up to two days and up to one day on cardboard, but it’s at less than 0.1% of the starting virus material. So far, evidence suggests that the virus does not survive as well on a soft surface (such as fabric) as it does on frequently touched hard surfaces like elevator buttons and door handles.

Clean the handle of the shopping basket or cart with a disinfectant wipe or hand sanitizer.
Don’t touch your face, and keep your phone in your pocket because it may harbor viruses — use a paper list instead.
Hard surfaces are more likely to be contaminated than soft surfaces (such as fabric), so be mindful of commonly touched surfaces such as payment equipment and self-checkout machines.

"Jason Villano, D.V.M., M.S., M.Sc., a veterinary expert at Johns Hopkins, says, “Despite the very few reports worldwide, including here in the United States, of sick and healthy domestic animals, including pets, testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, the official name for the virus that causes COVID-19, there is little evidence at this time that such animals are easily infected with the virus under normal conditions, or could transmit it.” The World Organisation for Animal Health in Paris, and in the U.S., the Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), are closely monitoring the situation but do not recommend routine testing of animals. The cases of the tigers in the Bronx Zoo and, more recently, of the two pet cats in New York, should not be cause for public alarm but a reminder that the COVID-19 crisis is actively evolving and that we have yet to learn more about the virus and its effects on both human and animal health.  At this time, experts recommend keeping pets indoors or avoiding socialization of pets with other animals, and maintaining good hygiene when handling or caring for your animals. 
Wash your hands before and after interacting with animals.
Don’t kiss your pets or let them lick you or share your food.
Walk dogs on a leash. Do not allow pets to interact with people or other animals outside of the household. 
ill with COVID-19 should let someone else take care of their animals. If this isn’t possible, patients should wear a mask while looking after their pet, and wash their hands before and after.

Wearing a cloth mask does not replace the need for physical distancing. The cloth face coverings recommended by the CDC are not surgical masks or N-95 respirators, which should be reserved for healthcare workers and first responders.

"The CDC recommends wearing cloth masks for the following reasons: 
A cloth mask can help individuals cover a cough or sneeze; reducing the spread of germs.
A cloth mask will not prevent you from breathing in respiratory droplets which carry a virus, like COVID-19.
Some people with COVID-19 have mild to no symptoms, and may be spreading the virus unknowingly. Cloth masks could help cut down how far the virus spreads.
Cloth masks can prevent you from touching your face, and can be a visual reminder to practice social distancing.

"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it’s not yet known whether pregnant women are more susceptible to getting COVID-19 or are likely to have more severe symptoms, compared with individuals of a similar age and health status, who aren’t pregnant. However, it’s still important for pregnant women to protect themselves from illnesses. We recommend to: 
Wash your hands frequently. You’ve heard this advice over and over, but for good reason. Cleaning your hands can really stop the virus in its track.
Practice social distancing. Maintain a 6-foot distance from other people, and avoid groups of individuals larger than 10.
Get the flu shot. It won’t protect you against COVID-19, but it will lower your risk of catching influenza — another more common respiratory illness that can cause complications for expectant moms.
Go virtual. Whenever possible, consider virtual prenatal visits with your doctor instead of in-person appointments. Spending less time in the waiting room and doctor’s office might reduce the risk of catching the virus. However, some important prenatal care visits will still need to be in-person, such as ultrasounds, fetal testing and some blood work.
Call your doctor if you’re coughing. If you develop flu-like symptoms such as a cough, fever, runny nose or shortness of breath, contact your doctor via telephone or virtual visit. They’ll determine if you should be tested for the coronavirus and what your next steps should be."

There are currently no studies that show evidence the virus can be passed from mother to fetus before delivery.

"The Lancet study looked at nine pregnant women who had COVID-19 during their third trimester. Doctors still aren’t sure how the disease might affect women and developing babies earlier in pregnancy, during the first trimester. High fevers in early pregnancy can increase the risk of some birth defects, however, little is known regarding how that affects pregnant women with COVID-19. That’s something doctors and researchers will be watching for as the virus unfolds.

"Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people and others cause illness in animals. Human coronaviruses are common and are typically associated with mild illnesses, similar to the common cold. COVID-19 is a new disease that has not been previously identified in humans. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people, and more rarely, these can then spread from person to person through close contact. There have been 2 other specific coronaviruses that have spread from animals to humans and which have caused severe illness in humans. These are the: 
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV)
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS CoV)"

"COVID-19 is a serious health threat, and the situation is evolving daily.

This does not mean that all Canadians will get the disease. It means that there is already a significant impact on our health care system. If we do not flatten the epidemic curve now, the increase of COVID-19 cases could impact health care resources available to Canadians. The risk for COVID-19 may be increased for certain settings such as: 
cruise ships
crowded areas (such as public transit and shopping centres)
gatherings (spiritual and cultural settings, theatres, sports arenas, festivals and conferences)"

"The Government of Canada is actively monitoring the novel COVID-19 and its impact on the supply of prescription and over-the-counter drugs, natural health products and medical devices in Canada. We do this through regular contact with:  
drug, medical device and natural health products manufacturers and importers
 provincial, territorial and international partners
 We are aware that there may be supply disruptions related to COVID-19 and are monitoring the situation closely. Companies that market prescription drugs for human use in Canada must report anticipated or actual drug shortages on Drug Shortages Canada. We have contacted companies to remind them of this requirement. Industry stakeholder associations have also been asked to notify us of any early signals of shortages related to COVID-19. Drug and medical device shortage signals can also be reported by the provinces and territories, healthcare professionals or the public.  We will continue to use all available tools to help manage critical national shortages when they happen, and work with partners so that Canadians have access to the medications they need.

"Canadians should continue to think ahead about the actions that they can take to stay healthy and prevent the spread of any illness, especially respiratory infections. Now and always during cold and flu season, stay home if you are sick. Encourage those you know are sick to stay home until they no longer have symptoms. Since respiratory viruses, such as the one that causes COVID-19, are spread through contact, change how you greet one another. Instead of a handshake, a kiss or a hug, a friendly wave or elbow bump is less likely to expose you to respiratory viruses. Practise frequent hygiene, which includes proper hand washing and coughing and sneezing etiquette. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces, such as toys and door handles. These are the most important ways that you can protect yourself and your family from respiratory illness, including COVID-19. 
Make a plan
If COVID-19 becomes common in your community, you will want to have thought about how to change your behaviours and routines to reduce the risk of infection.
Your plan should include how you can change your regular habits to reduce your exposure to crowded places. For example, you may:

do your grocery shopping at off-peak hours
commute by public transit outside of the busy rush hour
opt to exercise outdoors instead of in an indoor fitness class

Your plan should also include what you will do if you become sick. If you are a caregiver of children or other dependents, you will want to have thought ahead to engage backup caregivers.
You should also think about what you will do if a member of your family becomes sick and needs care. Talk to your employer about working from home if you are needed to care for a family member at home.
If you become ill, stay home until you are no longer showing symptoms. Employers should not require a sick leave note as that will put added pressure on limited health care services.
Your plan should include shopping for supplies that you should have on hand at all times. This will ensure you do not need to leave your home while you are sick or busy caring for an ill family member.
Your plan should build on the kits you have prepared for other potential emergencies. For more information on how to prepare yourself and your family in the event of an emergency, please visit GetPrepared.ca.
 
Fill your prescriptions
Refill your prescriptions now so that you do not have to go to a busy pharmacy if you do become sick. Consider seeing your health care provider to renew your prescriptions ahead of time.
 
Stock up on essentials but avoid panic buying
At this time, it makes sense to fill your cupboards with non-perishable food items, so that you do not need to go shopping if you become sick.
It is easier on the supply chain if people gradually build up their household stores instead of making large-scale purchases all at once. To do this, you can add a few extra items to your grocery cart every time you shop. Good options are easy-to-prepare foods like:

dried pasta and sauce
prepared canned soups
canned vegetables and beans

It is also a good idea to have extra stores of:

pet food
toilet paper
facial tissue
feminine hygiene products
diapers (if you have children who use them)

The reason for stocking up on these items is not necessarily because you will need to self-isolate. Having these supplies on hand will ensure you do not need to leave your home at the peak of the outbreak or if you become ill.
 
How to care for those who are ill
If you or a member of your family become ill with COVID-19, there are precautions that should be taken in the home. Your health care provider will advise you if hospital care is more appropriate. 
Children who have mild COVID-19 symptoms are able to stay at home with a caregiver throughout their recovery without needing hospitalization. If you are caring for a child who has suspected or probable COVID-19, it is important to follow the advice for caregivers. This advice will help you protect yourself, others in your home, as well as others in the community.
To prepare for these potential situations, you should have on hand:

soap
facial tissue
paper towels
alcohol-based hand sanitizer
household cleaning products
regular detergents for washing dishes and doing laundry
fever-reducing medications, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen
      
this includes products for children if you are a parent or caregiver


plastic garbage bags for containing soiled tissues and other waste
diluted bleach, prepared according to the instructions on the label, or in a ratio of 1 teaspoon (5 mL) per cup (250 mL)
      
this assumes bleach is 5% sodium hypochlorite, to give a 0.1% sodium hypochlorite solution



 
Get reliable information
Make sure that you get high-quality information about COVID-19 from reliable sources. The Public Health Agency of Canada is a reliable source of information, as are provincial and territorial public health authorities.
If you are finding that the news media is making you feel anxious, take a break from it.
 
Communicate with family, friends and neighbours
Let your family, friends and neighbours know that you are making plans to prepare for COVID-19. Share your plan with them, as this might motivate them to make their own.
Talk to them about a buddy system in which you agree to check in on each other and run essential errands if you become sick.
Think about the type of care you would want if you became seriously ill, and talk to family, health care providers or others who would be making decisions about your care if you were not able to do so.  These discussions can help caregivers feel more comfortable and confident in making decisions aligned with your wishes. 
It’s not always easy; some need help to  begin these difficult conversations. Visit advance care planning for information, tools, and prompts to  help with starting these conversations."

"Across Canada, we are changing the way we work to prevent the spread of COVID-19. For some workplaces, this may mean changing hours of operation, closing for a period of time or working from home. Others continue to go to work because their jobs are essential to keeping Canada functioning during this outbreak.  Essential workers are considered critical to preserving life, health and basic societal functioning. This includes, but is not limited to: 
first responders
health care workers
hydro and natural gas
critical infrastructure workers
workers who are essential for supplying society with critical goods such as food and medicines
 All employees should understand and comply with the infection prevention policies and practices in place in their workplaces. Employers should use the risk-informed decision-making guidelines for workplaces and businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Employers and employees will need to work together to protect their own health and their clients’ health, as well as deliver essential services.  
General advice

Increase awareness about COVID-19 through communication with staff. 
Evaluate the workplace for areas where people have frequent contact with each other and shared objects.
Increase the distance between desks and workstations as well as employees and customers (ideally 2 metres).
      
A physical barrier like a cubicle or Plexiglas window also works to increase distance between people. 



More information is available related to COVID-19 in the workplace for employers, employees and essential service workers (including work-related travel). 
 
Hygiene

Encourage frequent hand washing, sneeze and cough etiquette, and staying home when ill.
      
If COVID-19 symptoms develop, the employee should immediately be isolated from others and sent home without using public transit, if possible.


Ensure frequent cleaning and disinfecting, with particular attention to high-touch surfaces, such as:
      
bars
desks
phones
kitchens
computers
cash registers
elevator buttons
restaurant tables and menus


Provide access to handwashing areas and place hand sanitizers in prominent locations throughout the workplace, if possible.

 
Flexible work arrangements and sick leave

Where feasible, adjust policies to reduce social contact, such as:
      
flexible hours
staggering start times
teleworking arrangements
using email and teleconferencing


Relax sick leave policies to support employees in staying home when ill or monitoring symptoms.
      
This includes suspending the need for medical notes to reduce the burden on an already stressed health care system.


Prepare for increases in absenteeism due to illness among employees and their families or possibly school closures.
      
Access your business continuity plan for how to maintain key business functions if faced with high absenteeism.
Consider the need for cross-training personnel to function in key positions."
