Practice “social distancing.” Stay away from other people and large groups. If you need to be around others, try to keep 6 feet (2 meters) away. 3.        Get the flu shot.

However, you might still need an in-person visit for some things like ultrasounds or blood work. 5.        Call your doctor if you’re coughing.
