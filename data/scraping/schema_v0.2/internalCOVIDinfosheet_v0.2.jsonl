Scientists think that the main way you could get infected is if you were in close contact with an infected person and had your mouth, nose, or eyes exposed to infected respiratory droplets.

It is important to limit travel as much as possible.   If you think you need to travel, please go through these questions:   1. Is COVID-19 spreading in the area where you're going?  If it is, you may be more likely to get infected if you travel there than if you stay at home.   2. Will you or the people who you are traveling with be in close contact with others during your trip?  Your risk increases in crowded settings, especially closed-in settings that do not have good circulation. This includes conferences, concerts, etc.   3. Are you or your travel companion more likely to get severe illness if you get COVID-19?  People at higher risk for severe disease are older adults and people of any age with serious chronic medical conditions (e.g. heart disease, lung disease, diabetes). If you are at higher risk, avoid all cruise travel and non-essential air travel.   4. Do you have a plan for taking time off from work or school, in case you are told to stay home for 14 days for self-monitoring or if you get sick with COVID-19?  You may be asked to take time off, and be unable to go to work or school until you are considered non-infectious.   5. Do you live with someone who is older or has a serious, chronic medical condition?  If you get sick with COVID-19 while you travel, your family, friends, loved ones may be at risk of getting sick. People who are older and who have health problems are more likely to get very sick.  6. Is COVID-19 spreading where I live when I return from travel?  Even if you don't feel sick right now, you could pass on COVID-19 to others during travel without knowing it. This is very important if you'll be in contact with people who are older adults or have a severe chronic health problem. These people are at higher risk of getting very sick.   It is important to go through these questions to decide if it makes sense to travel.  [[Would you like more information about Who is at a higher risk of severe illness?]] [[Would you like more information about Is there Covid in my area?]]", "answerText": "If you are thinking about traveling, check the latest travel health notices for the most up-to-date travel advice before you go. It is important to limit travel as much as possible.   If you think you need to travel, please go through these questions:   1. Is COVID-19 spreading in the area where you're going?  If it is, you may be more likely to get infected if you travel there than if you stay at home.   2. Will you or the people who you are traveling with be in close contact with others during your trip?  Your risk increases in crowded settings, especially closed-in settings that do not have good circulation. This includes conferences, concerts, etc.   3. Are you or your travel companion more likely to get severe illness if you get COVID-19?  People at higher risk for severe disease are older adults and people of any age with serious chronic medical conditions (e.g. heart disease, lung disease, diabetes). If you are at higher risk, avoid all cruise travel and non-essential air travel.   4. Do you have a plan for taking time off from work or school, in case you are told to stay home for 14 days for self-monitoring or if you get sick with COVID-19?  You may be asked to take time off, and be unable to go to work or school until you are considered non-infectious.   5. Do you live with someone who is older or has a serious, chronic medical condition?  If you get sick with COVID-19 while you travel, your family, friends, loved ones may be at risk of getting sick. People who are older and who have health problems are more likely to get very sick.  6. Is COVID-19 spreading where I live when I return from travel?  Even if you don't feel sick right now, you could pass on COVID-19 to others during travel without knowing it. This is very important if you'll be in contact with people who are older adults or have a severe chronic health problem. These people are at higher risk of getting very sick.
