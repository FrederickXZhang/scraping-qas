For patients who require a physical exam, in-person appointments will remain as scheduled.  We are closely monitoring this evolving situation and our clinicians are meeting regularly to continue to prepare. If you have a fever, cough, diarrhea or shortness of breath, or are otherwise concerned you have COVID-19, we ask that you do not come to any Cleveland Clinic facility without calling your primary care physician or speaking to a provider using a virtual visit using Cleveland Clinic Express Care® Online. Patients will then be evaluated to determine if they require being seen in person or if they meet CDC guidelines for testing for COVID-19 based on symptoms, travel and exposures. If a patient meets criteria for testing, their Express Care Online provider or primary care physician will advise how to proceed with testing.", "questionUUID": "34135e46-7889-11ea-a667-9801a78e188f", "answerUUID": "34135f28-7889-11ea-a37c-9801a78e188f", "ID": "Cleveland Clinic|||-8241508049402055963", "answerContainsURLs": false, "answerToks2URL": {}}
