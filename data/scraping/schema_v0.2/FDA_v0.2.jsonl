On March 24, 2020, the FDA issued this guidance to facilitate veterinarians’ ability to provide veterinary telemedicine services during the COVID-19 pandemic. \nThe agency intends to temporarily suspend enforcement of portions of the federal veterinarian-client-patient relationship (VCPR) requirements relevant to certain FDA regulations. The VCPR is the professional relationship between the veterinarian, client (e.g., animal owner or caretaker), and the animal patient(s). The federal VCPR definition requires that veterinarians physically examine animal patients and/or make medically appropriate and timely visits to the location where the animals are kept. Therefore, the federal VCPR definition cannot be met solely through telemedicine.\nTo help veterinarians utilize telemedicine to address animal health needs during the COVID-19 pandemic, FDA does not intend to enforce the animal examination and premises visit portion of the VCPR requirements relevant to FDA regulations governing Extralabel Drug Use in Animals and Veterinary Feed Directive (VFD) drugs.
