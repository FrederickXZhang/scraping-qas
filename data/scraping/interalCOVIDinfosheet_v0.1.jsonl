", "answerText": "Generally, do not touch the body of someone who has died of COVID-19.   We are still learning how COVID-19 spreads. Currently, we think the virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from close contact with a person who has COVID-19 - likely through respiratory droplets that are produced when a sick person coughs or sneezes. This is like how the flu spreads. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of nearby people, and inhaled into lungs. As such, it does not seem like this type of a spread will be that much of a concern after death.  That being said, one could get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it, and then touching their face (like their mouth, nose, or eyes). However, we do not think this is the main way in which this virus is being spread.   Older people (over the age of 65) and those with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness. There may be less of a chance of getting the illness by holding the hand or hugging the deceased body after it has been prepared for viewing. Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, after, and during the body being prepared. If washing and shrouding the body are important cultural and religious practices, families should work with their community culutural and religous leaders as well as funeral home staff on how to reduce exposure as much as possible. It is recommended that those conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves. If fluid splashing is expected, additional personal protective eqiupment may be needed (like disposable gowns, goggles, face masks)    ", "hasAnswer": true, "targetEducationLevel": "NA", "topic": "", "extraData": {}}
