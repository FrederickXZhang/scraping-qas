What masks can be useful in for the general public is reducing the amount of times a person touches their face, which means less opportunity for COVID19 to enter their body. This is because the mask is covering a significant amount of a person's face (namely the mouth and nose). This is the most effective practice when used in combination with frequent hand-washing with soap and water, or with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.  However, these is a shortage of available face masks for health workers - which is dangerous as they are on the frontlines of this pandemic.   [[Would you like more information?]] There are currently not enough face masks for health workers to use, which is dangerous as they are on the frontlines of this pandemic. This ranges from basic surgical masks to respirator masks. Health workers are also being asked to reuse them. This situation makes health workers vulnerable to becoming infected with COVID-19. If you have a surplus of face masks, it is currently recommended to donate that to your local healthcare facility.

Until we know more, if you have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and have a pet or other animal: avoid close contact with them, do not snuggle or kiss them, or let them lick you, sit on your lap, or sleep in your bed, practice good cough etiquette, avoid coughing and sneezing on your animals, have another member of your household care for your animals (if this is not possible, always wash your hands before touching or feeding them), and limit your animal's contact with other people and animals (this may mean keeping them indoors)  To date, there have not been any reports of livestock being infected by COVID-19 anywhere.

We are still learning how COVID-19 spreads. Currently, we think the virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from close contact with a person who has COVID-19 - likely through respiratory droplets that are produced when a sick person coughs or sneezes. This is like how the flu spreads. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of nearby people, and inhaled into lungs. As such, it does not seem like this type of a spread will be that much of a concern after death.  That being said, one could get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it, and then touching their face (like their mouth, nose, or eyes). However, we do not think this is the main way in which this virus is being spread.   Older people (over the age of 65) and those with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness. There may be less of a chance of getting the illness by holding the hand or hugging the deceased body after it has been prepared for viewing. Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, after, and during the body being prepared. If washing and shrouding the body are important cultural and religious practices, families should work with their community culutural and religous leaders as well as funeral home staff on how to reduce exposure as much as possible. It is recommended that those conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves. If fluid splashing is expected, additional personal protective eqiupment may be needed (like disposable gowns, goggles, face masks)", "hasAnswer": true, "targetEducationLevel": "NA", "topic": "funerals", "extraData": {"author": ""}}
