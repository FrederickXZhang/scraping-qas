How can you tell the difference between the novel coronavirus and a cold or influenza (flu)?	The symptoms are similar, including fever, cough, and shortness of breath. To diagnose a potential case, healthcare professionals may use a COVID-19 diagnostic test and/or run tests to rule out flu and other infections. Individuals with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms, ranging from mild to severe illness. Symptoms may appear two to 14 days after exposure to the virus and may include:  fever; cough; shortness of breath or difficulty breathing; chills; muscle pain; headache; sore throat; new loss of taste or smell;  If you develop any symptoms and think you have been exposed, call a healthcare professional immediately.

There is evidence that the novel coronavirus can be spread before an individual develops symptoms. This poses a problem because people who do not know they are infected may continue to go to work, school, and other public places. People who are sick and have symptoms are more likely to stay home, which means fewer opportunities for the virus to spread from one person to another. When asymptomatic transmission occurs, infection control experts and public health officials may need to take additional measures, such as social distancing, isolating patients, or using quarantines.

State and local authorities are carefully tracking the occurrence of COVID-19 in each community. Once  the number of cases starts to decline, federal, state, and local authorities will consider how to end social distancing and will likely do so gradually. The White House has released a three-phased approach to help state and local officials determine how and when to scale back social distancing guidance and continue to protect public health. Follow the advice of local public health authorities and continue healthy habits like washing your hands and avoiding touching your face.

COVID-19 is a new virus in humans, so it is too early to predict whether it will become seasonal. If it behaves like other respiratory viruses, including flu, it could abate as the weather gets warmer and become part of the usual cold and flu season. But scientists do not yet have enough information to know for certain. That’s why ongoing research to develop vaccines and antiviral drugs that are effective against coronaviruses is so important.

There are several ways that an outbreak can come to an end. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak was controlled through close coordination between public health officials and clinicians who were able to diagnose cases, isolate infected patients, trace their contacts, and implement strong infection control policies. An outbreak can dwindle once the virus has infected most of the people who are susceptible to it, because it has fewer targets, as was the case with the Zika virus outbreaks in recent years. If COVID-19 behaves like other respiratory viruses, including flu, it could abate as the weather gets warmer and may become part of the annual cold and flu respiratory season.

Older adults and people who have chronic medical conditions including heart disease, lung disease, diabetes, cancer, and hypertension are at higher risk for more serious COVID-19 illness and death. This is because our immune systems grow weaker as we age, which makes it more challenging for older adults to fight off infectious diseases. Chronic diseases are more common with age, can compromise the immune system, and make people more vulnerable to serious complications. Because of the rapid spread of COVID-19, the CDC recently issued a warning for people who are at the highest risk for serious illness from the virus. It is imperative older adults and others who are at high risk heed the advice of the CDC.

COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly between people in close contact with one another through respiratory droplets from coughs or sneezes. It may also be transmitted when you touch a surface or object with the virus on it, then touch your mouth, nose, or eyes. It is important to avoid people who may be infected. Older adults and those with underlying health conditions that can put them at increased risk should stay home to avoid being around others. Nursing homes and retirement and long-term care facilities should halt social visits. The White House advises that all individuals avoid:  Gatherings of more than 10 people; Non-essential air travel, and; Cruise ships (Note that major cruise lines have suspended trips and others are restricting passengers over the age of 70);  For older adults and adults with underlying health conditions, the CDC advises taking extra measures to put distance between yourself and others including:  Staying home whenever possible; Considering ways to get food, medicines, and essentials delivered to your home;  This is an important advisory to follow, because there is currently no vaccine available to prevent COVID-19 and no specific antiviral medication to treat it. The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to the virus. Proper handwashing is also imperative to preventing COVID-19 infection and spread. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, sneezing, or being in a public place. If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol. Avoid handshaking and touching high-traffic surfaces in public places–for example, elevator buttons, door handles, handrails, or counters. Use a tissue or your sleeve to cover your hand or finger if you must touch something. Avoid touching your face, nose, eyes, etc. To prevent the spread of the virus, it is important to stay home and avoid crowds. If you do need to go out in public, practice social distancing (stay at least 6 feet apart) and wear a cloth face covering to help prevent the spread of the disease to others. Surgical masks and N-95 respirators should not be used by the general public, as they are in short supply and should be used only by healthcare workers and caregivers who are taking care of infected individuals in close settings (at home or in a healthcare facility). Although there is no vaccine available to prevent COVID-19 at this time, you should still ensure that you and your family’s vaccinations are up to date, including influenza (flu) and pneumococcal (pneumonia) vaccines. This will help reduce the pressure on the healthcare system by reducing vaccine-preventable diseases.

Here are some important but simple steps you can take in preparing to remain at home for an extended period: Ask your physician or local pharmacy if ordering your medicines online is an option. Many online pharmacies (including national chains) will fill valid prescriptions and ship them directly to your door allowing you to avoid going to the pharmacy in person. CMS is also working with private plans to waive prescription drug refill limits and to relax restrictions on home or mail delivery of prescription drugs. However, only order from a reputable online pharmacy. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns consumers about rogue online pharmacies that claim to sell prescription medicines at deeply discounted prices. Read the FDA warning here. If you have questions, call a healthcare professional. Also, be sure you have over-the-counter medicines and medical supplies (fever reducers, tissues, hydrating beverages, etc.) to treat fever and other symptoms. Have enough basic household items and groceries on hand so you are prepared to stay at home for an extended period of time. Most major grocery chains have made it possible to order groceries online and have them delivered to your door. Check the websites of local or national grocery stores that may allow you to select your items online and then arrange for shipping. Keep in mind, however, that many of these services are experiencing delays due to the high volume of people choosing the safety of online ordering rather than in-person shopping. This means you will need to plan ahead. If you have questions or concerns about the delivery timeline, speak to a customer service representative. If you must go out for groceries, try to find a local grocery store that offers hours just for older adults. Most of these hours are earlier in the day and offer a chance for older adults to shop without as much exposure. Remember to cover your nose and mouth with a face covering, stay vigilant with handwashing, and avoid touching your eyes, mouth, and nose since COVID-19 can remain on certain surfaces for hours and in some cases, days.

Everyone has a role to play in reducing community spread. The same recommendations for people at risk should be adhered to by everyone to help protect the more vulnerable in our communities. Businesses, schools, and local and federal government should all work together to mitigate community spread of COVID-19 and help protect older adults and those with pre-existing medical conditions. If you are a caregiver for someone in a long-term care facility, respect their rules on who can come and go, ask about the health of the other residents frequently, and know the plan if there is an outbreak. If your loved ones live alone, check on them frequently and find out what services your local Area Agency on Aging offers.

Although COVID-19 can affect anyone, individuals at greater risk of severe illness from COVID-19 include the following:  Older adults (age 65 years and older); People with chronic medical conditions like heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and lung disease, including moderate to severe asthma; Those living in a nursing home or long-term care facility; People of any age with severe obesity (body mass index [BMI] >40);  Others who may be at high risk of more severe illness include those who are immunocompromised due to cancer treatment and other conditions. People of any age with severe obesity (body mass index [BMI] >40) or certain underlying medical conditions, particularly if not well controlled, such as those with renal failure or liver disease may also be at risk. Although COVID-19 does not appear to affect pregnant people differently than others, pregnant women are at greater risk of getting sick from other respiratory viruses than people who are not pregnant. If you are pregnant, be mindful about reducing your risk of getting sick and teach your family everyday steps (such as proper handwashing) to stay healthy. CDC maintains up-to-date information on those at higher risk of serious illness from COVID-19.

There are currently three types of COVID-19 tests authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA):  ; Molecular tests are used to detect the genetic material of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Molecular tests are fairly accurate and can be used to diagnose the disease.; ; Antigen tests are a new category of tests that can quickly detect fragments of the virus from nasal swabs. Antigen tests can provide results in minutes, but they are not as sensitive as molecular tests. Positive results from antigen tests are highly accurate, but negative results may need to be confirmed with a molecular test.; ; Antibody (or serology) tests detect the body’s immune response to COVID-19 by looking for antibodies in the blood to help determine prior exposure. When the body is fighting an infection or has fought an infection, antibodies can be found in the blood. These tests do not detect the actual virus but are used to identify people who have been infected with the virus in the past.;  FDA has authorized more than 100 tests for emergency use including 91 molecular tests, 12 serology tests, and 1 antigen test. Accuracy varies among all of the tests. The resulting uncertainty can complicate public health decisions. Some antibody tests have a high potential for false-negative and false-positive results. They may not be able to detect antibodies in the blood of someone who is newly infected, and they may not be able to distinguish SARS-CoV-2 from other coronaviruses. The presence of antibodies may indicate immunity from COVID-19, but that has not yet been conclusively proven; nor do scientists know the duration of protection. Although serologic tests should not be used at this time to determine if an individual is immune, these tests can help determine the proportion of a population previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 and provide information about populations that may be immune and potentially protected. Serologic test results should not be used to make decisions about returning to school or the workplace. Additional data are needed before modifying public health recommendations based on serologic test results, including decisions on discontinuing physical distancing and using personal protective equipment.

Face masks can help prevent an infected individual from spreading the virus. You can make your own face mask at home. CDC recommends using breathable cloth such as 100 percent cotton, with two layers of fabric for optimal filtering. When held up to a bright light, the fabric should not let a lot of light shine through. Face coverings should:  Fit snugly but comfortably against the side of the face; Be secured with ties or ear loops; Allow for breathing without restriction; Be able to be laundered and machine dried without damage or change to shape;  Face masks are not recommended for children less than age two years or by individuals who have trouble breathing or who cannot easily remove them. N-95 respirators are in short supply and should be reserved for healthcare professionals and other first responders. Remember: Face masks are not a substitute for other preventive measures—continue to wash your hands properly, avoid touching your face, and maintain social distancing (stay at least 6 feet apart from others) in conjunction with wearing face masks in public spaces.

Currently, there is no proven drug for treating patients with COVID-19. The disease is still new, and scientists are still learning about the virus that causes it. Drugs to treat COVID-19 may be given to patients as part of a clinical trial, so that scientists can determine the effectiveness of the treatments. Many such studies are underway in the United States and other countries. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has developed new treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov). The guidelines, which will be updated as experts learn more about the disease, include recommendations on antiviral drugs such as remdesivir, chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine, as well as other treatments such as convalescent plasma and immune globulins.

"It’s felt a lot like 2008, hasn’t it? Peter S. Goodman, an economics correspondent for The Times, says there’s a key difference between that economic turmoil and today’s: the utter unpredictability of the outbreak’s spread. “The disaster feels eerily familiar, with trillions of dollars in wealth annihilated near-daily and deepening fears that businesses will fail,” he writes. “Yet the traditional policy prescriptions seem no match for the affliction at hand.”
The very means of controlling the health crisis — keeping workers home, limiting travel and disrupting commerce — risk making the economic crisis worse. 
“A sense of powerlessness is feeding the fear that is prompting investors to dump anything risky, which is in turn damaging economic prospects and reinforcing fear — a feedback loop,” he writes.

What’s that about?	"With the $2 trillion stimulus legislation passed by Congress on March 27, federal lawmakers agreed to provide $1,200 in direct payments to millions of Americans. How much you receive depends on your income. Single adults with Social Security numbers who have an adjusted gross income of $75,000 or less will get the full amount of $1,200. Married couples with no children earning $150,000 or less will receive a total of $2,400. And taxpayers filing as head of household will get the full payment if they earned $112,500 or less. For every qualifying child age 16 or under, the payment will be an additional $500.
If you earn above these income figures, the payment decreases until it stops completely for single people earning $99,000 or married people who have no children and earn $198,000. According to the Senate Finance Committee, a family with two children will no longer be eligible for any payments if their income is above $218,000. In any given family and in most instances, everyone must have a valid Social Security number in order to be eligible.

"The stimulus plan includes a significant expansion of unemployment benefits that would extend jobless insurance by 13 weeks. The program is aimed to help freelancers, part-time workers, furloughed employees and gig workers, such as Uber drivers, as well as full-time employees who have lost their jobs.
States have set their own rules for eligibility and benefits, which are generally calculated as a percentage of your income over the past year, up to a certain maximum. Some states are more generous than others, but unemployment typically replaces about 45 percent of your lost income. Under the plan, eligible workers would get an extra $600 per week on top of their state benefit.

"Student loans The Department of Education has granted a payment waiver of at least 60 days to many people. But it’s not necessarily automatic. In general, you have to call your loan servicer to request a waiver and to make sure that your loan is eligible. The waiver does not apply to private student loans. One big private lender, Sallie Mae, said it is offering suspension of payment for up to three months, with no damage to a borrower’s credit.
With the stimulus package, there will be automatic payment suspensions for any student loan held by the federal government until Sept. 30. It may be hard to contact many of the loan servicers right now, so check your account online in the coming weeks. 
Utility bills Some utility providers are offering to stop cutting people off for nonpayment. A number of large internet companies have agreed not to terminate residential or small-business customers who can’t pay their bills.

Housing There’s also a good chance you can delay your mortgage payment if the outbreak has left you short of money. The Federal Housing Finance Agency has instructed mortgage servicers to allow borrowers whose mortgages are owned by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac to delay payments. If you rent, the best national resource we’ve found so far is the search-by-state function on Justshelter.org. This offers information on local organizations that can provide advice to renters in distress. 
Loans and credit Many consumer lenders are offering affected customers help if they can’t make payments. The American Bankers Association has a list of lenders here, although the help they’re offering varies. Some say they will allow borrowers to skip payments; some are offering other accommodations.

"If you lost your job (and with it your health insurance), or even if you never signed up for a policy, you may have options. Some states and employers have loosened the rules around when you can sign up for insurance because of the pandemic.

"A coronavirus emergency relief package, passed by Congress in mid-March, gives qualified workers two weeks of paid sick leave if they are ill, quarantined or seeking a diagnosis or preventive care for the coronavirus, or if they are caring for sick family members. It gives 12 weeks of paid leave to people caring for children whose schools are closed or whose child care provider is unavailable because of the coronavirus.
Many workers at small and midsize companies and nonprofits can get the paid leave, as can government employees, as long as they’ve been employed at least 30 days. The law includes people who don’t typically get such benefits, like part-time and gig economy workers. But it excludes those at companies with more than 500 people, including many front-line employees at many major retailers and fast-food restaurants. 
Workers at places with fewer than 50 employees are included, but the Labor Department could exempt small businesses if providing leave would put them out of business. Employers can also decline to give leave to workers on the front lines of the crisis: health care providers and emergency responders.

Those antibodies are contained in plasma, and the hypothesis is that extracting the plasma of a recovered patient then transfusing it into a sick patient may help that person recover more quickly.

Maintaining social connection, despite physical distance, is also important. Reach out to others via phone calls, emails or video chats, and talk through the feelings you’re experiencing. It’s important to be gentle with yourself, and maintain any kind of routine you can to have a sense of stability.

Working out, whether that means taking a socially distant walk or doing an at-home routine, can also help tire you out and dispel extra nervous energy. Taking a warm shower or bath 90 minutes before lights out may also help prime you for a better night’s sleep.

Ms. Gottlieb recommends staying in the present as much as possible, versus thinking about the future or ruminating on things that haven’t happened yet. Try the “both/and” method: Let yourself feel your loss in the present while simultaneously promoting feelings of safety by taking actions like reading a book or video-chatting a friend.

Take stock of how any stress and anxiety may have affected your eating habits. 
If you think you’re snacking too much when you’re not hungry, it may help to allow some time to pass and distract yourself with another activity before grabbing more food. Try to add some healthy snacks like fruits and vegetables into your routine, if you can.

"Until a few months ago, most of us didn’t give hand sanitizer much thought. Now it’s sold out around the world, prompting a variety of do-it-yourself recipes that are designed to be mixed up in a home kitchen.

And then there’s the larger concern that sanitizer — whether it’s store bought or home made — is not as effective at killing germs as just washing your hands with soap and water.
“I’d rather people use liquid soap and water, and then moisturize, which I know is going to be effective, than use a half-baked recipe of alcohol sanitizer that I hope is effective,” said Dr. Ted Lain, a dermatologist and chief medical officer for Sanova Dermatology, a group of 15 medical practices in Texas and Louisiana.

"It’s a complicated question, right? Officials are telling us to stay indoors and away from others. At the same time, you need food or, as importantly, medicine. But what about the health of the delivery workers who come to your door? How do we keep each other safe?
For older Americans and those with health problems who are most at risk if they contract the coronavirus, having goods delivered makes sense. Some companies, like Postmates and Instacart, have begun offering non-contact or curbside deliveries. European companies are doing it, too.
Those services have a large network in place, though, which means their businesses are likely to thrive. Smaller retailers will not as Americans eschew restaurants, bars and specialty stores. That is why some restaurants are promoting delivery services as a way to stay in business, and why some cities that have ordered restaurants and bars to close have made exceptions for places providing delivery and takeout.
But what about delivery workers? Some groups, like Gig Workers Rising, are demanding that employers like Doordash and Instacart do more to protect them on the job. Recently, the group started a petition asking companies to provide paid time off to drivers who become sick during the coronavirus outbreak and cannot work.
The bottom line is this: Online deliveries are a boon for those who cannot leave their homes, as well as small restaurants who fear going out of business. But at the same time it comes with a risk to drivers and delivery workers who fear the loss of income if they get sick. At a minimum, everyone should generously tip their drivers for the service.

"Several states have already postponed their primaries. Officials in states that are going ahead with primaries have been trying to emphasize the new basics of voting hygiene, like using hand sanitizer at polling stations. 
And though the general election has yet to begin, it is already being profoundly shaped by the coronavirus, which has become the central issue between President Trump and the two major Democratic candidates, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. The pandemic’s effects on the economy have challenged Mr. Trump’s core message, that Americans are better off than before he took office. Mr. Biden has proposed a detailed plan for hospitals and research, echoing the language of presidents in past crises. He and Mr. Sanders curtailed their travel and canceled large gatherings like rallies. 
It would be enormously difficult to cancel or postpone the November general election, though.

How far can the government go?	"The federal government can impose quarantines under the Public Health Service Act to prevent the spread of communicable disease into the United States or between states. They’re considered a measure of last resort when there’s no other way to stop the spread of a deadly disease. On the state and local level, the laws vary depending on the region.
Still, the U.S. government doesn’t have the authority to impose a quarantine as sweeping as China, which confined some 70 million people in the largest effort in history. In the U.S., quarantines have been very rare. The last one was in the 1960s against a suspected smallpox outbreak. Health warnings are more common, like in 2016 when the C.D.C. advised pregnant women to avoid Southern Florida during an outbreak of the Zika virus.

"A lot has to do with politics and history. While some places, like Hong Kong, have had extensive experience with serious outbreaks and quickly put in place a plan to contain the virus, others were slower to react and failed to take the outbreak seriously enough, according to the W.H.O. That’s contributed to the lack of a united response. While the W.H.O. is supposed to coordinate the global response to epidemics, the group, a U.N. agency, doesn’t have the authority to force countries to follow its plan.
Culture and government also play a role. Chinese citizens responded quickly to aggressive restrictions put in place by their authoritarian government, while Italians weren’t initially as compliant."

"It’s not clear, and keeping Congress at work in the Capitol may prove untenable, especially if more lawmakers fall ill or as staff and services dwindle. 
During the Cold War and after Sept. 11, 2001, the government devised emergency plans to protect government officials, like a nuclear bunker for Congress in West Virginia, now a tourist attraction. Those plans relied on the ability to gather lawmakers in a safe place together, however — a hazard during a pandemic. 
""There's no serious effort to grapple with what could happen in the event of a major catastrophe,"" said Norm Ornstein, a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute who pushed for plans in the wake of Sept. 11. He said that a bill to allow remote voting during a national crisis, put forward by Senators Rob Portman and Richard Durbin, was ""a good start.""
So far, congressional leaders have resisted calls for remote voting, calling it a bad precedent and saying they need to address the current crisis. They have instead looked for ways to practice social distancing within the Capitol. ""There's reason to be wary about a virtual Congress,"" Mr. Ornstein said, like ensuring cybersecurity and that Americans can still see and hear lawmakers at work.
But he added that House and Senate leaders, through legislation or rule changes, could create the capacity for remote voting only in the most extreme circumstances, such as when many members are incapacitated or transportation to the Capitol or an alternate meeting place becomes impossible."

"Fewer children seem to get infected by the coronavirus than adults, and most of those who do contract it have mild symptoms, if any. 
A very small number of children with the virus have shown symptoms associated with toxic shock or Kawasaki disease. This is a rare illness in children, according to the New York City Health Department, that involves inflammation of the blood vessels, including coronary arteries.
Two studies conducted in recent weeks offer compelling evidence that children can transmit the virus. While neither proved it, many epidemiologists who were not involved in the research said that the evidence was strong enough to suggest that schools should be kept closed for now.

"Complete disinfecting protocol includes four steps: wiping a surface of obvious dirt and residue; “dwell time” to let the disinfectant sit; wiping the surface clean; and rinsing with water. 
When disinfecting a surface, the most important consideration is what’s known as “dwell time”: the amount of time the disinfectant needs to remain on a surface to kill pathogens. These days, that means specifically the coronavirus that causes Covid-19. 
No disinfectant works instantly; most products sold to the public take 30 seconds to several minutes. To find out how long the recommended time is for a specific product, check the label. And note that some products may claim to sanitize — which means they reduce the level of certain bacteria, but not viruses. A disinfectant claim means that the product destroys or inactivates both the bacteria and the viruses noted on the label.

Is it OK for me to just feel like crying sometimes?	"“Crying can be very cathartic because when you cry, you are taking deep breaths,” said Lisa Feldman Barrett, professor of psychology at Northeastern University and author of “How Emotions Are Made.” Those big gulps, she said, most likely increase activity in the parasympathetic nervous system, which helps to calm us down. 
Lauren Bylsma, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, also said that crying alone can soothe us, because “it sort of focuses you on what’s bothering you.”

"The level of risk in an elevator depends on many factors, including its size, how fast it travels between floors, how long its doors stay open and whether it has a ventilation system. 
Most elevators aren’t big enough to allow people to stay six feet apart, so there’s a chance that infected passengers could transmit the virus. And even if you’re riding the elevator alone, buttons and side rails are a potential risk if your hands become contaminated and you touch your face, although the risk is low.
The solution for those of us who must use elevators is to take common sense precautions. First, when possible, avoid riding with another person. And always wear a mask inside the elevator, even if you’re riding alone — a mask will help protect you from the last passenger, and will protect the next passenger from your germs. Avoid touching your face after touching elevator buttons, and wash your hands afterward. And if you must ride with another person or two, don’t get in unless everyone inside is wearing a mask.

"By their very nature, athletic facilities like gyms tend to be germy, and gym equipment can be difficult to sanitize. In a study published earlier this year, researchers found drug-resistant bacteria, flu virus and other pathogens on about 25 percent of the surfaces they tested in four different athletic training facilities.
If your gym is open and you plan to go, disinfect yourself and any surfaces that you touch frequently. Wash your hands frequently, and use hand sanitizer. Disinfect every surface you touch, and when spraying a disinfectant, give it time — a minute or so — to kill germs before wiping. Clean any grime or dust off surfaces first.

"As the weeks morph into months with no clear end in sight for the pandemic, the ennui of coronavirus-induced isolation can undermine our enthusiasm for getting anything done.
If that sounds familiar, remember: Doing what’s meaningful — acting on what really matters to a person — is the antidote to burnout.
Motivation might best be fostered by dividing large goals into small, specific tasks more easily accomplished, but not so simple that they are boring and soon abandoned. Avoid perfectionism lest the ultimate goal becomes an insurmountable challenge. As each task is completed, reward yourself with virtual brownie points (not chips or cookies!), then go on to the next one.
But even more important than personal tasks you consider tackling is to think about what you can do for other people, within the constraints of social distancing or lockdown. If you can, contribute money to efforts to get more food, especially nutritious food that too often now goes to waste, to people who don’t have enough to eat, as well as to our essential workers.

“The good news is that the virus dies off relatively quickly in direct sunlight,” she said. “There’s often some wind at the beach, which really helps disperse the virus particles in the air.”

Some colleges, including California State University, have announced that they will reopen in the fall, largely online-only. Other college institutions, along with public and private elementary and high schools, are trying to figure out how they can open safely, if they can at all this fall. New York, for example, is tentatively planning to reopen its 1,800 public schools in September, along with hundreds of day care sites. But children will not be able to start school and relieve their parents of home schooling and child care duties without shots to protect them against illnesses like measles and chickenpox.
Some institutions are taking steps to limit the semester, including the University of South Carolina, Notre Dame, Rice and Creighton, which will forego a fall break and try to get students home before Thanksgiving in an attempt to avoid a “second wave” of coronavirus infections expected to emerge in late fall.

Before going out, check your community’s health. Dining rooms are open again in several states that have not met the criteria for progress against the virus suggested by the White House for a phased reopening. At the very least, check the latest data on coronavirus cases in your city or county before making up your mind.
Ask the restaurant ahead of time about their safety protocols, and consider whether you would feel safe in that environment. Once you arrive but before you choose to dine, look at the setup in the restaurant; if it seems too crowded or too cramped, reconsider going in (or, if dining outside is an option, do that). Wearing a mask while having a meal is tricky, but try to wear it in between bites or drinks. Wash your hands often, and avoid touching common surfaces when possible.
Anyone who has symptoms of Covid-19 or who has recently come into contact with someone who has had the virus should stay home, and anyone who falls into one of the high-risk categories identified by the C.D.C. should be especially cautious about going out to restaurants.

"The risk of outdoor transmission is low, but it is possible. There is a growing consensus among experts that, if Americans are going to leave their homes, it’s safer to be outside than in the office or the mall. With fresh air and more space between people, the risk goes down.
But experts also expressed particular caution about outdoor dining, using locker rooms at pools and crowds in places like beaches. While going outside can help people cope with quarantine fatigue, there is a risk they will lower their guard or meet people who are not being safe.
Ideally, you should socialize only with people who live in your home. If you decide to meet friends, you’re increasing your risk, but you can take precautions.

"There’s already evidence that growing numbers of people are depressed. From Feb. 16 to March 15, the number of antidepressant prescriptions filled in the United States rose by 18.6 percent. A University of Michigan survey of some 460 people, conducted in mid-April, found 33.6 percent of respondents reported symptoms of major depression, including fatigue, insomnia and feelings of hopelessness.
Most experts expect to see rates of depression and other psychological disorders increase in the coming months, as the pandemic continues. And yet, a majority of those who seek treatment for depression will improve if they persist.
Even so, mental health specialists are reluctant to label what people are experiencing as depression, in the usual sense.
“I don’t know anyone right now that’s not having depression-like symptoms,” said Luana Marques, a psychologist at Harvard Medical School and the president of the Anxiety and Depression Association of America. “It’s hard to keep going when our brains are constantly on fight or flight. It makes people really tired. If you’re having trouble concentrating or getting out of bed, it’s not abnormal. It’s an evolutionary response to a threat.”
Familiarize yourself with depression’s physical and mental markers. Or take a self-diagnostic test. When depression isn’t severe, a self-care routine may be enough.

Without access to our usual coping tools, everyone “is going to try to rely on each other and that makes sense and that’s normal,” said Melissa Martin, a clinical counselor in Chicago. “But we need to be able to be in a place where we have the emotional energy and capacity.”
So, decline the call and follow up with a text. In general, experts agree it’s better to be honest, more or less, stopping short of, “I just don’t want to talk to you.” 
Maybe your phone was off, or you were reading or watching TV. Just say that. Even in the midst of a pandemic you’re entitled to your own space, including mentally.

"In April, a dog in North Carolina tested positive for coronavirus, as did two pet cats in New York and a eight tigers at New York City’s Bronx Zoo. However, there has been no evidence that pets such as dogs or cats can spread the coronavirus, according to the World Health Organization and the C.D.C. (The animals showed mostly mild symptoms — though the tiger was “visibly sick” — and have recovered.)
Still, if you are sick with coronavirus, it is best not to pet your family dog. And avoid petting other people’s dogs as well."

In March, as more and more governments around the world hoped to slow the spread of the coronavirus, they imposed travel restrictions and many closed their borders. Now some states and countries are opening up, but it's a complicated patchwork of what is open and whether self-isolation or quarantines are required for entry.
And if you do have to travel, remember to practice social distancing: Stay away from groups and keep at least six feet of distance between you and other people. Many destinations, from Spain to Massachusetts, continue to urge visitors to self-isolate for two weeks after entry.

Most important: Wash your hands often, and stop touching your face.
If possible, choose a window seat. A study from Emory University found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window, as people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people.
Disinfect hard surfaces. When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down, too. (Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.)

What’s recovery like?	"Most people who catch the virus have few symptoms or none, but some get very sick, most often with pneumonia. Any pneumonia damages the lungs, which can take months to heal, and doctors warn that the harm might not be completely reversible.
Studies also point to kidney, heart, liver and neurological damage, often from secondary infections, and no one knows what the long-term prospects are for those patients.
As for returning to exercise after recovering, two new expert-consensus statements from pulmonologists and cardiologists, published separately in The Lancet and JAMA Cardiology, urge caution. Experts advise athletes who have tested positive for the coronavirus or suspect they might be positive to rest, without any exercise, for at least 10 days from the point when they first feel symptoms. Then, assuming their illness remains mild, they should continue to rest for another week, even after their symptoms resolve.
Still, there is a bright side of recovery: A new study found that nearly everyone who has had the disease — regardless of age, sex or severity of illness — makes antibodies to the virus, and several small studies have given reason to hope that people who have had Covid-19 would gain some immunity for some period of time.

"The CARES Act provides one-time payments of $1,200 to most Americans, but it depends on your income. Single people making less than $75,000 and married couples making less than $150,000 get the full amount. So do taxpayers filing as head of household earning $112,500 or less. For every qualifying child age 16 or under, the payment will be an additional $500. (College students don't qualify if someone else is claiming them as a dependent.)
There are limits. If you earn above these income figures, the payment decreases until it stops completely for single people earning $99,000 or married couples who have no children and earn $198,000. According to the Senate Finance Committee, a family with two children will no longer be eligible for any payments if their income is above $218,000.
Millions of people have already received their payments automatically. But people who do not usually file tax returns may have to fill out a special form for non-filers.

"Good question. Governments worldwide have made major mistakes in trying to contain the outbreak. But as the virus spreads, South Korea and China have been more effective than others at bringing it under control. South Korea, for example, has aggressively monitored infections, such as by checking the body temperatures of all incoming and outgoing passengers at train stations and operating drive-through testing centers. However, as restrictions on the public have eased, a cluster of infections has cropped up around Seoul, forcing the mayor of the city to shut down the capital’s bars and nightclubs. 
New Zealand and Australia have both largely prevented a large number of casualties and deaths, aided by countrywide lockdowns that began before the virus had largely impacted their countries."

"Many people will emerge from the pandemic with some psychological scarring, but how you handle stress makes a difference in how you ultimately cope. You can create positive habits and reduce response patterns that predict post-traumatic stress disorder, in which a terrifying event leads to symptoms such as disturbing flashbacks and severe anxiety. Unfortunately, we can’t will away sadness and fear. Living through such emotions without exacerbating your pain and suffering takes skill.
Still, for most of us, “the most common response to trauma is resilience,” said Dr. Denise Sloan, a professor in psychiatry at Boston University and associate director of the National Center for PTSD. In fact, the overwhelming majority of people who endure a life-threatening event recover on their own and never meet the criteria for PTSD. 
Ultimately, it’s crucial to balance accepting difficult feelings, without multiplying them, while increasing your emotional immune system. Later, when this ends, if you find yourself becoming a “super avoider” — someone who tries to escape thoughts and situations that are no longer harmful — remember that it’s important to face your fears.

What can I do?	"In some cases, exposure to stressful events — which right now might include the absence of routines, a parent’s job loss and economic hardship, or the serious illness or death of someone a child cares about — can leave children feeling traumatized.
When we see a child acting in a manner that we think is inappropriate, we need to consider that the child is outside her window of tolerance for stress. Monitor their behavior closely, and consider seeking counseling if you aren’t sure whether the stress response you’re seeing is normal.
Talking about the pandemic and its impact may help avoid the harmful effects of stress. Help your kids understand that there are things they can do to help others — like staying home whenever possible and wearing a mask when they go out. Kids feel good when they know they are helping solve a problem.
Also, avoid making assumptions. While we may be struggling with schools being closed, kids could be rejoicing in it. We might assume our kids miss their friends, but they may appreciate having more time with us. And some who were dealing with bullying or social challenges at school may be relieved not to have to see other kids.

"A life in seemingly endless lockdown and isolation from grandchildren is not how grandparents want to spend their golden years.
To start, families need their own reality check about the actual level of vigilance by every member of the household. So as a first step, think about human contacts, big and small, by every member of the household. How many times did someone go to a store? Did you meet up with a friend for a walk? When you jog, how close are you to other runners? And so on.
Next, try to seal the “leaks” in your quarantine bubble. While it may be impossible to get your contact risk to zero, you can eliminate the biggest risks (like outside visitors), reduce shopping trips to once a week or less, improve hand hygiene and wear a mask. 
The biggest worry is being in an enclosed space with someone who has the virus but doesn’t know it, so keep everyone outside, if possible. But if a child must enter a grandparent’s house, monitor them and allow it only when the grandparent is outside. Everyone should wear a mask, and sanitize the bathroom after use. If the grandparent is visiting you, designate one disinfected bathroom just for them and keep children outdoors.

South Korea did not lock down cities in the same way, but was extremely fast to test people, trace their contacts and quarantine infected people. And although China and South Korea have demonstrated that, with drastic actions, the virus can be brought under control, pockets of resurgence are being seen as their countries reopen. 
The United States has taken a much more piecemeal, state-by-state approach to confronting the virus. Some states are beginning to reopen non-essential businesses and services, while others are announcing reopening plans as still others remain under lockdown. It is still unknown how long it will take to bring the whole country back to its fully opened state."

"In labs around the world, there is now cautious optimism that a coronavirus vaccine, and perhaps more than one, will be ready sometime next year, and from what scientists are learning about the coronavirus, it ought to be a relatively easy target.
More than 100 research teams around the world are taking aim at the virus. Companies like Inovio, Moderna and Pfizer have begun early tests in human subjects. Researchers at the University of Oxford in England, who are also testing vaccines in people, say they could have one ready for emergency use as soon as September.
And researchers at a Harvard Medical School hospital, working with Johnson & Johnson, just published research showing that a prototype vaccine effectively protected monkeys from infection with the virus.
Still, ensuring that vaccines are safe and effective demands large trials that require careful planning and execution, and this will be deployed at an unprecedented scale. No factories have ever churned out millions of doses of approved vaccines made with the cutting-edge technology being tested by companies like Inovio and Moderna. Manufacturing vaccines is profoundly more complex than manufacturing, say, shoes or bicycles. They typically require large vats in which their ingredients are grown, and these have to be maintained in sterile conditions

For contact tracing to be most effective, it should be carried out as soon after diagnosis as possible. If you have tested positive for COVID-19, you will likely be contacted quickly by a public health professional to initiate contact tracing. It is important to remember, though, that not being contacted for contact tracing does not mean you did not test positive or that you cannot transmit COVID-19. Proper precautions, such as social distancing, regular hand washing, and wearing a mask, should still be taken.

COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person, especially between close contacts (people within about 6 feet of each other). When an infected person talks, coughs or sneezes, droplets from their mouth can spread through the air and land in the mouths or noses of nearby people. COVID‑19 can also spread from the hands to the mouth, nose, or eyes. Sick people are the most contagious but people who don’t have symptoms can also spread the virus.

"There is currently no vaccine to prevent COVID-19. The best way to prevent infection is to avoid being exposed. Take the following precautions to avoid exposure:
Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, you can use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
Clean and disinfect frequently-touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash and wash your hands.
Stay home when you are sick.
When you must go out, practice social distancing."

Social distancing involves staying at least 6 feet away from other people to avoid catching or spreading a virus. It's a fancy term for avoiding crowds and minimizing physical contact. The safest thing to do during an outbreak is stay home as much as possible and minimize close contact with others. When you must go out, such as to shop for groceries, stay at least 6 feet away from others.

If you have had close contact with someone who has COVID-19, monitor yourself for symptoms for 14 days after the last day you were exposed to protect your health and those around you. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Other symptoms may include, muscle aches, fatigue, sore throat, chills, headache, runny nose, abdominal pain/discomfort, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. If you are 65 or older or have a medical condition (such as heart, lung, or liver disease, diabetes or cancer), or are on kidney dialysis, and you have been exposed to someone who has COVID-19—call your doctor. ▲ Top

By staying home and only going out into public for essential activities, such as grocery shopping or picking up medications, you will minimize your exposure to COVID-19, and fewer exposed people means fewer cases of the disease. At this time, slowing the rate of infection, or flattening the curve, remains very important. Flattening the curve means fewer people are sick all at the same time. This helps our hospitals from becoming overrun and unable to treat everyone who needs care.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends members of the general public wear a cloth face covering in light of new data about how COVID-19 spreads. The virus is thought to be spread mainly from person to person when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks.A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the person who is wearing it. But, wearing a cloth face covering may prevent the person wearing it from spreading COVID-19 to the people around them. Sometimes infected people don’t have symptoms. So even if you don’t feel sick, wearing a cloth face covering may help prevent you from spreading COVID-19 to those around you.To be effective, the cloth face covering should cover your nose and your mouth.

Wear a cloth face covering whenever you are out in the community, such as when getting groceries, medication or medical care. These face coverings help when you can’t avoid being in the same space as others. Wearing a cloth face covering does not mean you don’t need to stay away from others. Social distancing, or staying at least 6 feet from others, is still necessary to keep you and others safe.

"Yes. Wearing a cloth face covering is just a part of your overall protection plan to keep you and others from spreading and getting COVID-19. That plan includes:
Social distancing, or staying at least 6 feet away from other people
Frequent hand washing with soap and water for 20 seconds
Not touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands
Avoiding close contact with people who are sick
Staying home when you are sick
Covering your coughs and sneezes with a tissue

According to the CDC, we do not currently know if pregnant women have a greater chance of getting sick from COVID-19 than the general public nor whether they are more likely to have serious illness as a result. With viruses from the same family as COVID-19, and other viral respiratory infections, such as influenza, pregnant women have had a higher risk of developing severe illness. It is always important for pregnant women to protect themselves from illnesses.

Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, you can use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
Clean and disinfect frequently-touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash and wash your hands.
Stay home when you are sick.

The virus is new, and much is being learned about it. Current evidence suggests that it may remain for hours to days on surfaces made from a variety of materials. Cleaning of visibly dirty surfaces followed by disinfection with EPA-approved disinfectants is a best practice measure for prevention of COVID-19 and other viral respiratory illnesses in households and community settings.Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks. If surfaces are dirty, clean them using detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection. To disinfect, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants will work.

By well maintained, we mean that the system is inspected periodically, the filters are changed according to manufacturer recommendations, the duct systems are cleaned periodically, and the most efficient filters available are used (for example, MERV [minimum efficiency reporting  value] filters with a rating of 13 to 16 for homes; HEPA [high-efficiency particulate air] filters for hospitals). Keep in mind, that even in well-ventilated environments, people should continue following recommendations of physical distancing, face covering, and frequent hand hygiene. At present, there is no strong evidence to suggest that a well-maintained air conditioning, ventilation, or other type of climate control system will contribute to the transmission of COVID-19.

That’s true with influenza: Even if a certain strain disappears, a new one might emerge from animals—as we’ve seen with avian viruses. But with a major outbreak like COVID-19 already underway in humans, the big question is how good humans are at developing immunity. And, if they gain immunity, does it stick, or does it fizzle out over time—leaving the door open a crack for the virus to return? As the first cases get further and further out from the point of infection, that data will give us a better idea of what to expect.

Infection with SARS-CoV-2 is associated with respiratory tissue damage that can impair lung function and even cause death. Though it is likely that both the virus and immune system contribute to this process, it can be difficult to determine which mechanism causes the most damage. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 is associated with respiratory tissue damage that can impair lung function and even cause death. Though it is likely that both the virus and immune system contribute to this process, it can be difficult to determine which mechanism causes the most damage. To establish infection, a virus must enter a host cell. Once inside, it hijacks the cell’s machinery to replicate, eventually killing the cell and releasing more virus. This process not only damages host tissues, but also potently activates the immune system. The immune system in turn unleashes powerful weapons to control the infection. However, if not carefully regulated, the immune response itself can cause collateral damage to host tissues and exacerbate disease severity. More research on the host and viral factors that contribute to severe COVID-19 disease and death could provide important clues for clinicians and researchers in the search for new treatments.

Data transparency and political sensitivity are two of the most critical challenges to effective global cooperation on the COVID-19 outbreak—and they are deeply entwined. Data transparency and political sensitivity are two of the most critical challenges to effective global cooperation on the COVID-19 outbreak—and they are deeply entwined. China has a history of concealing, delaying or refusing to share data and information (this happened with SARS in 2002-2003 and in 2018, when China reportedly refused to share samples of a bird flu with pandemic potential). Leading global health agencies have praised China’s response to COVID-19, while other experts doubt the accuracy of the reported data. Data transparency is key to building much-needed trust—and preventing the misallocation of resources, which could slow the response. Some countries in Asia—where China holds significant economic and political influence—have carefully crafted their public coronavirus responses, aware that criticizing China could hinder cooperation. And all stakeholders face a difficult task: balancing effective disease response with the political sensitivity necessary for a successful, cooperative, global response.

The development of vaccines and drugs for COVID-19 share common goals: to ensure safety and efficacy. These are often assessed through a series of studies, sometimes beginning with animal experiments, progressing through human phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical trials with increasing numbers of participants. However, it often takes much longer to develop and rigorously assess a vaccine. First, vaccines are usually targeted to healthy people, in contrast to drugs administered to people with disease. Larger and longer studies are often needed to ensure the safety of vaccines. Second, the outcomes of interest often take much longer to be measured. Vaccine efficacy and immunogenicity can take many months to measure accurately, whereas whether or not a treated patient improves can take days. And some vaccines require multiple doses spread out over months whereas drug treatment regimens typically are days to weeks. Once developed, it can also take longer to manufacture and deploy vaccines.

2.  Provide intensive support to the body of a sick person as their immune system battles the infection: We see that some patients may become critically ill with this disease, hence they may need mechanical ventilation or urgent dialysis. There may be a role for technologies such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation to help their lungs recover from acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Travel bans can’t keep all cases of the virus out of a country. As the epidemic expands, cases may originate in any number of countries. We may already have unrecognized cases in the US. Travel bans can actually make us less safe. They can make countries facing restrictions not want to share information about their outbreaks. They can disrupt the distribution of supplies needed to control the epidemic. Similarly, as we saw with the US’s Ebola response in 2014, quarantining returning travelers makes doctors and nurses less likely to volunteer to serve in affected countries. This virus is likely past the point of containment. We need to focus on mitigating its impact by speeding the development of diagnostic tools, vaccines, and drugs to treat infections.

"Infection rate and progression to severe disease in pregnant women is similar to that in nonpregnant adult women. The same protective measures against transmission of the virus apply to both.
 
So far, no transmission from mother to fetus has been described. Vaginal delivery should be encouraged when both the mother and the baby are not severely sick. Strict protective measures (facemasks, hand hygiene) must be observed to protect the newborn and the personnel during and after childbirth.
 
Separation of the mother and baby and breastfeeding should be discussed on a case-by-case basis with the mother. The newborn should be protected from infection by the mother as much as possible. If the mother wishes to express her milk or breastfeed, disinfection of the breast should be added to the protection methods mentioned above."

But that’s only part of the story. By definition, pandemics cross national boundaries—they are global in nature and they require a global response, not just a national one. A whole set of “transnational” activities, called global public goods, is another critical plank in pandemic preparedness. These require collective funding by countries. Such goods include developing medical countermeasures like pandemic vaccines, diagnostics, and treatments, stockpiling of medical supplies (including personal protective equipment), and ensuring that there is global “surge capacity” to rapidly scale up production and distribution of vaccines.

The tools of public health during suspected infectious outbreaks include limits or restrictions on the movement of individual citizens, ranging from travel bans, to closure of businesses and schools, to isolation of individuals in their homes, to forced quarantine in medical facilities. The goal in implementing public health measures during suspected outbreaks is to balance the freedom of individuals against the restrictions on freedom required to achieve legitimate protections of the public's health, with public and transparent justification of policy decisions. Whatever restrictions are implemented should be the least restrictive to accomplish the stated public health goals. Quarantine is considered a measure of last resort given the severe restrictions it imposes on individual liberty, and when misused or ineffective can severely undermine trust in government.

"The symptoms of COVID-19—including fever, cough, and difficulty breathing—are similar to those of other cold and flu viruses. At this moment, the decision to test for COVID-19 in the US depends on both the patient’s clinical status and what is happening in a particular geographic location. A history of travel, especially international travel to one of the most affected areas, is still important, but this is evolving as the outbreak develops domestically. Close contact with someone who traveled to those areas or with someone who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 are other considerations.
The evaluation of cold and flu symptoms will often include testing for routine respiratory viruses as well, especially influenza. In general, if you do not have symptoms and would not ordinarily seek medical care based on how you feel now, you do not need evaluation or testing for COVID-19."

The CDC believes it is likely that COVID-19 will cause a pandemic, but there are steps that the public can take to protect and prepare themselves. First, it is important to stay informed and follow instructions issued by your local or state health department and the CDC. Basic infection control measures still apply in this scenario. Practicing good handwashing techniques or using hand sanitizer, avoiding people who are ill, and staying home when you are sick are all effective measures. A pandemic could interrupt supply chains and result in closures at local businesses, meaning it may be prudent to stock reserves of critical supplies. Examples include extra prescription medications, asthma relief inhalers, over-the-counter anti-fever and pain medications, non-perishable food items, household cleaning supplies, and toiletries. However, do not hoard - this could create shortages.

"The likelihood of getting infected with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) through export goods originating from China or elsewhere is quite low. Although SARS-CoV-2 can survive on surfaces from 2 hours to 9 days, it is vulnerable to heat, changes in pH, and common disinfectants.  Since SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus (meaning it has a fragile outer layer), it is less stable and more susceptible to disinfectants. Therefore, the risk of an infected person contaminating commercial goods is low—and so is the risk of catching the disease from a package that has been transported and exposed to different conditions (and temperatures).
So, feel free to order that dress from China or those leather shoes from Italy. While you are at it, wash your hands and maybe wipe the surface with a disinfectant because informed preventive measures are what we need to stop both COVID-19 and the fear epidemic from spreading."

Cash can be contaminated with potential bacterial pathogens, but there is little information about viruses on cash in general—and nothing about contamination with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 is spread by person-to-person contact—not normally by touching fomites (objects that may be contaminated with, and help transmit, infectious organisms) like cash. And, it’s unclear how long COVID-19 remains viable on surfaces—ranging from a few minutes to hours to potentially days depending on the temperature, humidity and surface type. Switching from cash to plastic has not been proven more protective, either, except perhaps by reducing person-to person hand exposure. Some countries are washing or disinfecting cash, but there is no data demonstrating how this process works. The best practice is social distancing: limiting person-to-person contact by shutting down schools, bars, and other crowded places. That is what will slow infections, prevent health care systems from overloading, and reduce deaths. That is why everyone should do their part and embrace social distancing rather than worrying about using money or credit cards.

The reproductive number represents the average number of people that one infected person will infect. The reproductive number for a disease can change based on how infectious the pathogen is, the host population, and environmental factors. To control an outbreak, the goal is to reduce a disease’s reproductive number to less than 1. If the reproductive number remains 1 or higher, the outbreak will continue. In the case of COVID-19, the estimated reproductive number is around 2.6, meaning the outbreak is expected to continue. The reproductive number can be reduced by altering transmission dynamics—with social distancing, home isolation, quarantine, and use of personal protective equipment in health care settings. Over time as people are infected and recover—or if a vaccine becomes available (which may take months or years)—immunity in the population also reduces the effective reproductive number of a disease.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 will likely continue with minimal variation. It will probably stay stable because very few people are immune—so many “naïve” human hosts are still available for maintaining current transmission cycles. This virus appears very balanced in terms of transmission-to-virulence. It also can be transmitted early in infection. Serious disease usually doesn’t occur until much later—and by that time, many patients are confined to a hospital bed. Consequently, a long transmission window is present before a person falls seriously ill, giving the virus plenty of time to spread. Selection is heavily driven by transmissibility, and the role of virulence in this process is much less clear.

COVID-19 doesn’t pose any known risk to blood donors during the donation process or from attending blood drives. Blood donation is a highly regulated, safe process—and most centers have implemented additional precautions including increased sanitation of donor areas, use of PPE, and social distancing to enhance their already-healthy environments. Additionally, since donors must be healthy on donation day, risk of exposure to sick individuals is extremely low. While donors may worry that they could be infected but asymptomatic, respiratory viruses are not generally thought to be transmitted by blood transfusion. There are no reported cases to date of transfusion transmission of COVID-19. Even during a shelter-in-place, people still require critical medical care. They will continue to be in car crashes, need emergency organ transplants and chemotherapy, and give birth to babies in critical condition. The need for blood is constant, and we continue to rely on blood donors’ generosity.

Cryptic transmission is the term that is used when there is no direct contact between person 1 shedding the virus and person 2 contracting it. Cryptic transmission is the term that is used when there is no direct contact between person 1 shedding the virus and person 2 contracting it. It is an important indicator of community prevalence of a virus. There is essentially enough circulating virus in a community to transmit the same strain of the virus between individuals who are not directly linked. In the case of the COVID-19 outbreak, this term came into the lexicon after University of Washington researchers sequenced the COVID-19 genome from Snohomish County, Washington, which showed a direct genetic link from the first 2 cases in Washington though they had no known contact. This indicated there was significant community spread, and likely evidence the virus had been circulating for weeks by that point. As I noted on Twitter, the key takeaway is this is going to be a critical path for viral transmission given the potential infectivity prior to the manifestation of symptoms—and what will ultimately make it so hard to control the spread of the virus.

Then, you need to reduce the problem of antibody-dependent enhancement. ADE means that some respiratory virus vaccines can actually make things worse. There are multiple ways to solve this problem. One option is creating a vaccine that only uses parts of the pathogen to stimulate the immune system. One approach is to do this by producing recombinant protein subunit vaccines. We have found that these vaccines that use a part of a protein of the virus (the spike protein) and known as the receptor binding domain (RBD) are optimal for 2 reasons: Recombinant proteins are a standard technology that has resulted in other licensed vaccines, including the hepatitis B and HPV vaccines; and it’s possible to produce this vaccine in abundance and at low cost.

It is likely that 60-65% of Northern Hemisphere populations will be infected with the virus by July or August. As the epidemics seem to diminish later in the summer, action will shift to the South, with COVID-19 sweeping across Latin America, Africa and the South Pacific, similarly infecting upwards of 60% of populations. And then by December, it will make a slow return to the Northern Hemisphere, creating a North/South cycle that will persist for years.

Mortality rates will vary by country according to several factors. First, it will depend on the age structure of the population; Italy has the second oldest population in the world, which  may partly explain the high mortality observed. Health care availability (in terms of the number of hospital and intensive care beds) and accessibility (free versus paid) will also influence mortality. For example, low death rates in Germany and South Korea are partially attributed to the relatively high number of hospital beds per capita. Moreover, disparities in death rates between Hubei province—the location of Wuhan, where the outbreak first emerged—and other parts of China are thought to be due to the rapid case rise and resulting strain on health care resources in Hubei. Lastly, a country’s testing policy will be an important determining factor. If there is widespread testing of community as well as hospital-based cases, mortality will be lower than if testing was solely focused on hospital cases.

But clearly not all people become sick even in the worst pandemics. Epidemiologists typically mean an infectious disease epidemic that has spread or is spreading globally. Usually we refer to a pandemic only when it involves a new disease. So, for example, we talk about an influenza pandemic when there is a new strain of flu spreading around the world. In contrast, we do not refer to the global outbreak of seasonal influenza as a pandemic because the strains are not new. There is no strict definition of when an epidemic becomes a pandemic—but usually it means that the disease is actively spreading on several continents with likely continued spread to other continents.

"About 60% of newly emerged and re-emerging pathogens share a common origin: the bodies of animals. Genetic and epidemiological evidence suggest that the novel coronavirus, like SARS, may have emerged from a so-called “wet market,” where wild species that would rarely encounter each other in nature are crammed together, allowing microbes to spread between species and into humans. China claimed to have cracked down on these markets after the SARS outbreak, but when I visited a few years later, it wasn’t hard to find one. 
But such markets are only part of the problem. The loss of wildlife habitat around the world more generally is forcing wild species to cram into closer proximity to human settlements. Bats, for example, have been fingered as the source of Ebola, SARS, and a host of other pathogens. When we cut down the forests where they live, they come roost in our backyards and farms instead. It’s this kind of novel, intimate contact that provides opportunities for the microbes that live in their bodies to spread into ours.

Part of the reason we stopped SARS is that a lot of super spreading was happening in health care settings and when people really got their act together in terms of infection control and biocontainment, it nipped the epidemic in the bud. Super spreading events have the largest influence an outbreak’s trajectory early on. If there’s only a few cases and one person then infects 10 others, it can make it start strong. Once an epidemic gets going and has 100 to 200 cases or more, the “law of large numbers” takes over—and it stops mattering so much.

Contact tracing involves finding out who the infected person had contacts with so that those individuals can be alerted that they are at a risk of developing the illness and at risk of potentially infecting others in the community.During contact tracing, the contacts of the infected person are generally called up, asked if they're feeling sick, and advised to self-quarantine for a period of time.

"Not reliably because the number of tests affects the number of confirmed cases: If you do more tests, you’ll find more cases.
 
A better—but still flawed—approach would be to use the number of COVID-19 deaths and back-calculate the number of infected cases. So, if there are 500 COVID deaths in a community and you assume a mortality rate of 1%, then that would indicate that there would be at least 50,000 cases. Why? Because 500 is 1% of 50,000. But this has problems, too. It doesn’t include recent infections; the number of COVID deaths may be under-reported; and it depends on the death rate. These points suggest 50,000 cases is likely an underestimate.
 
So, what do we do? We need good public health surveillance. We need to take representative samples of the community and test them. That’s the best way to get reliable estimates.

However, there is little evidence to suggest a benefit against the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, for patients already taking these drugs. In 2003, clinical studies using HIV protease inhibitors—specifically, the FDA-approved oral combination treatment lopinavir/ritonavir—to treat SARS were associated with reduced mortality and intubation rates. However, the studies were retrospective and not controlled clinical trials. Still, amid the desperate search to find treatments for the novel coronavirus, researchers have carried out clinical studies using these drugs on COVID-19 patients—despite the lack of published data documenting their utility against SARS-CoV-2. Based on the data so far, there is little reason to expect patients taking HIV protease inhibitors will see a benefit against COVID-19—either to protect from infection or to speed recovery.

Research into COVID-19 and patients who take immunosuppressing drugs is still scarce. However, investigations from Italy found that patients with systemic autoimmune diseases do not seem to have an increased risk of becoming infected. Needless to say, immunosuppression impairs innate and adaptive immunity and is a risk factor for severe COVID-19 illness. While this holds true for the majority of patients, a subset of COVID-19 patients exhibit “hyper-inflammation""— an immune system activation triggered by the virus. The impact of initiating immunosuppression in these COVID-19 patients is being tested in several ongoing clinical trials. Patients should consult with their physician on the need to take immune system-suppressing medication. Some circumstances require long-term intake of immunosuppressing drugs, [such as with] organ transplantation and abrupt withdrawal poses a risk to patients to have organ failure due to rejection. This in turn would lead to hospitalization and the need to intensify treatment—increasing not only the chance of becoming infected but also the risk of a severe COVID-19 disease course."

Early in the outbreak, there were concerns that Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) may increase the risk of COVID-19 illness, but medical organizations have concluded that they pose no increased risk—and have proven lifesaving benefits.
 
However, for patients who require a ventilator, it may be necessary to adjust or stop certain cardiac medications based on blood pressure and heart status.
 
Symptoms for COVID-19 and an active cardiac issue—such as shortness of breath and chest discomfort—can be similar. If heart medications are not being taken consistently to control cardiac symptoms, it is more difficult to distinguish between COVID-19 and a cardiac event. 
 
While some patients are understandably apprehensive about seeking care during the pandemic, it is crucial to not delay. Research in Italy showed that visits to cardiac units halved during the outbreak—coinciding with an increase in out-of-hospital deaths from heart attacks."

Earlier diagnosis can help in 2 ways: Earlier diagnosis can help in 2 ways: We now know that certain therapies that have shown promise in treatment of COVID-19 work better when given earlier in the disease course, including remdesivir and convalescent plasma. This is likely because damage from the disease occurs not only from the direct action of the virus, but also the impact of overactivation of the immune system in response to the infection, which leads to inflammation, and finally from abnormal blood clotting as a result of multiple factors. It makes sense that if we can catch patients as early as possible and keep their bodies from going down this path, it may result in better outcomes. Diagnosing those with COVID-19 symptoms in the community as early as possible also allows public health officials to advise patients to isolate, to ensure that infected patients are not passing on the disease to others.

While not confirmed for COVID-19 directly, it is common knowledge that chemical lung exposures increase the infection risk. Always wear a mask, especially during crowded protests. Protect your eyes with safety goggles or glasses in case you are hit by objects, or where there is dust and smoke. When the police use tear gas, move away quickly.

One small study of 34 Chinese men diagnosed with COVID-19 found no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 in their semen or testes ~1 month later. Another study—which didn’t address the sexual transmission question—found the virus in 6 of 38 patient semen samples. But that study involved much sicker men; the viral load by that stage could be a factor. And, severely ill people aren’t likely having sex; that’s a bigger question during recovery. Studies on patients with SARS-CoV-2 in their semen, testing weekly to see if and when it clears, could inform guidelines on how long post-diagnosis men should refrain from sex. Regardless, sex—impossible from a 6-foot safe distance—still isn’t a good idea for at least several weeks later, given the established risk of respiratory transmission.

"Right now, it appears that COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, causes more cases of severe disease and more deaths than the seasonal flu. People over age 85 have the highest risk of fatality and children under 19, the lowest, but this could change as more people are tested and trends become clearer. If, over time, widespread testing reveals more mild, non-fatal cases of COVID-19, the death rate will go down.

Can I be tested for COVID-19 or seek medical treatment for COVID-19 and get coverage through the emergency-only coverage (CAWEM)?	"You can still see a doctor if you don’t have medical insurance. This includes care in the emergency room, at community and migrant health centers, free clinics, and public hospitals. 
If you have CAWEM, CAWEM plus, OHP,
or private insurance, you won’t be charged for a test or treatment for COVID-19, including going to the hospital. 
The Governor has reached an agreement with insurers so that people will not have to pay anything out of pocket for COVID-19 tests or hospitalizations from COVID-19.
If you are undocumented or have been a legal permanent resident (green card holder) for less than 5 years, you may be eligible for the Oregon Health Plan’s (OHP) Citizen/Alien Waived Emergency Medical (CAWEM) benefit which includes emergency medical, dental and transport services including services at a hospital emergency room and being
hospitalized if needed. CAWEM also includes all services for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. This coverage is not limited to emergency rooms and hospitals. OHA can reimburse providers for COVID-19-related services regardless of service location. Coverage includes non-emergency settings such as medical offices and urgent care.

The receipt of emergency Medicaid, such as CAWEM, cannot be counted under U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service’s (USCIS) public charge rule. Additionally, on March 13, 2020 USCIS issued an alert on its website stating​ that the agency will not consider testing, treatment, or preventive care (including vaccines, if a vaccine becomes available) related to COVID-19 as part of a public charge determination. You should seek the medical treatment or preventive services you need to protect your health and the health of others. This includes if your care is paid for in whole or in part by Medicaid, also known as the Oregon Health Plan. 
If you do not have Oregon Health Plan (OHP) coverage or Citizen/Alien Waived Emergency Medical (CAWEM), you can apply for it here​. If you don’t want to sign up for OHP because of the public charge rule, you can see a clinician through your county health clinic or through a federally qualified health clinic (FQHC). If you have any important medical, mental health or medication needs be sure to mention this when you call.

"During this time of increased stress, it’s important to
prioritize your mental well-being. Our lives have been disrupted in ways both
large and small. Be gentle with yourself, adjust your expectations and allow
yourself time to get used to the new normal. 
It’s OK if you are struggling to adapt or if you are feeling
fearful or sad. These are natural reactions to an unusual situation. If you
feel this way, reaching out to others can help. Try to build some social
connection into your regular routine – it’s best not to wait for sadness or
loneliness to set in, since sometimes that can make it harder to reach out. 
You can help others while you help yourself: check in regularly with friends and neighbors
to offer support, especially to those who might be struggling more during this
time.
Older adults, people who experience disabilities, parents
with young children, and those living with mental health or substance abuse
challenges might be feeling especially isolated right now. If there is someone
in your life who you think might need a little extra connection, reach out to
them.
It’s natural to struggle with feelings of sadness,
frustration, fear, or anxiety during this time of increased isolation. Some
additional tools that some have found helpful to cope with these feelings
include:
Guided
relaxation, meditation, or mindfulness exercises  
Physical exercise
Writing in a journal
Creative expression like singing or making music, creative
writing, or 
Creating artwork
If you’re struggling now with your behavioral health, you are
not alone. Help is available, please reach out. Find resources in the
behavioral health section of the OHA COVID-19 page.
If you need support or just want someone to talk to, there
are many resources available. Find resources in the behavioral health section
of the OHA
COVID-19 page.
If you need behavioral health services, telehealth care is
available. Your health care providers may provide care to you using telephone
or video platforms. This way, you can get the care you need while staying home.
Contact your care provider or your health plan to learn more.
Staying active is good for your mind and your body. Outdoor
exercise, alone or with your household members, can be a fun way to relax and
can help combat sad or anxious feelings. You can also exercise in your own
home, alone or with online classes like yoga or Zumba."

your children safe. Lock up guns and medications even if you trust your child or teen and feel they are safe. It only takes a moment for someone to hurt themselves in a temporary moment of despair or anger.
Remember,
children follow the lead of their parents. They look to you to see if they
should be afraid, concerned, confident, calm or carefree. You can set the stage
for their response to be concerned and confident by taking a moment to check in
with yourself before you check in with them. 
Consistency
and structure can help establish a sense of normalcy and be calming. 

Try to establish a simple routine for your
family in 60- or 90-minute chunks.
Get your children involved in the planning
process to give them a sense of control. 
Consider including routine mealtimes and
consistent bedtimes and wake up times.
Physical activity has been shown to combat symptoms of anxiety and depression.
Taking regular breaks to go outside for fresh
air and exercise is great for mental health.
Look for free online resources for
youth-focused at-home workouts, such as Fitness Blender Kids Workout - 25
Minute Fun Workout for Kids at Home.

Relearn
how to be present with your family. 

Being present and available for your family
can be the best way to support and help during this stressful time. 
Consider working on tasks or projects
alongside your children and set aside time to offer your family your full and
undivided attention.

Maintain
technologic well-being:

The key to healthy screen use is awareness and
open conversations with your children. 
Consume news judiciously from reputable
journalism organizations, the Oregon Health Authority or
the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention. 
Participate in technology alongside your
children, for example by engaging with them via social media apps or video
games they frequently use.

provider thinks you may have COVID-19, he or she will first determine if you
are well enough to stay home or if you need to go to a clinic or hospital. Healthcare
providers may also work with local public health to arrange for testing for the
virus. 
Testing​ will likely involve:

A nose swab and throat swab.
A routine blood sample.
Coughing up mucus, if possible.



If you are
seen in a clinic or hospital, your health care provider may ask you to:

Put on a mask to limit spread of the virus.
Make sure you are not around other people.


Care
providers may:

Show you to a private room.
Put on equipment to protect themselves such as:
gowns,
gloves,
eye protection, and
s​pecial masks.






There is no
specific treatment for COVID-19. The goal is to support the person who is ill,
supply oxygen if needed, and help lessen the symptoms until the immune system
kicks in and kills the virus. Most people with COVID-19 appear to have mild
disease that doesn’t require a medical visit. 
As with flu, most people can recover at home without problems. Those
with fever and cough who get significant trouble breathing, or feel faint, or parents
of a child who gets bluish color of the skin around the mouth should call promptly
and arrange for medical evaluation or call 911.
If you are
tested for COVID-19, staff from your local health department will call you.
They will ask you for details about recent travel and people you have been
around. Your care providers and public health staff will give you information
about how to keep from spreading the virus to your family and friends."

Two earlier coronavirus outbreaks appear to have started from viruses in a host animal. For SARS, it was the masked palm civet. For MERS, it was dromedary camels.

Health experts recommend that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay home. Employees should not come to work if they have:
Fever (100.4° F [38° C] or greater using an oral thermometer).
Other symptoms like cough, vomiting, or diarrhea.
People should be without fever or cough for 72 hours without using fever reducing medicines like aspirin or acetaminophen before returning to work or school. This applies to everyone, not just people that have been tested for COVID-19.
Employees should inform their supervisor and stay home if they are sick.
Separate sick employees from other employees.
This is what CDC recommends. Also, those with fever or acute respiratory illness symptoms should go home immediately:
Upon arrival to work, or
During the day, if symptoms develop while at work.
Help your workplace stay healthy.
Emphasize that all employees should:
Stay home when sick, and make sure workplace policies allow sick
leave so that people can do the right thing by protecting their co-workers.
Cover their coughs and sneezes.
Wash their hands frequently.
For more information visit these CDC websites:
Coughing and Sneezing
Handwashing: Clean Hands Save Lives

Perform regular cleaning of the workplace. Make it a routine to clean all surfaces that people often touch. Examples are workstations, countertops and doorknobs. Use cleaning agents usually used in these areas and follow the directions on the label.
Know how to respond to employees after exposure or who are sick.
Employees who are well but who have a sick family member at home with COVID-19 should:
Tell their supervisor.
Refer to CDC guidance for how to conduct a risk assessment of their
potential exposure.
Contact their local public health department.


If an employee develops COVID-19 infection, employers should:
Work with public health to determine which co-workers had close,
prolonged contact with the ill employee that might put them at risk of exposure to COVID-19. 
Maintain confidenti​ality as required by the Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA).
Employees who have exposure to a co-worker with confirmed COVID-19 should:
Refer to CDC guidance for how to conduct
a risk assessment.
Contact
their local public health department.
Review your outbreak response plans and make sure they are up to date. If you do not have a plan, now is the time to develop one. All outbreaks are reportable. That includes those in the workplace. Contact your local public health department​ if you believe you have an outbreak. They will be able to guide you through how to respond.

your children safe. Lock up guns and
medications even if you trust your child or teen and feel they are safe. It only takes a moment for someone to hurt
themselves in a temporary moment of despair or anger. 
For those who
experience or are at risk of experiencing suicidal thoughts:

​Restrict access
to lethal means in your household - it has been proven to save lives!
​Keep
over-the-counter and prescription medications in a medication lockbox or locked
cabinet.
Ensure firearms
are kept in a gun safe with a trigger lock and store ammunition separately.
Alcohol and other
mind-altering substances can impair judgement and lower inhibitions.
​Consider removing
these from the home or keeping them in a locked cabinet.
Sharps such as
knives, razor blades, and scissors are frequently used to engage in
self-injurious behaviors.
Limit access to
these items when youth are unsupervised.
Develop a safety
plan with your child, such as this one: Patient
Safety Plan Template.
Discuss warning
signs, coping strategies, and healthy activities that can distract your child
from thoughts of self-harm when they do occur.
Have a list of
names and contact information that your child can reach out to for distraction
or help when needed.
Entirely removing
access to technology as a consequence can be very isolating for your child.
​Cutting off a
lifeline to a teen’s friends can result in an emotional backlash and disruption
in the parent-child relationship.
When a lapse in
judgement is related to phone use, ask your child about the behavior and
consider limited privileges targeted to the problematic behavior.
Aim to teach your
children to manage their own relationship with technology.

"In a public health emergency, the role of OSPHL is to begin laboratory testing before commercial labs can test and perform laboratory testing for prioritized populations. As a lower-volume laboratory, OSPHL bridges the gap between emergence of new infections, such as COVID-19, and availability of testing through commercial laboratories. OSPHL also supports testing for vulnerable populations. As more commercial laboratories begin testing, OSPHL may begin to support public health by conducting testing for surveillance purposes rather than direct patient care.
Commercial laboratories now offer expanded capacity for clinicians to order COVID-19 testing at their discretion. Local health systems have started to offer testing in their laboratories, further expanding testing capacity. Collecting samples for commercial lab testing can be done in the outpatient setting if clinically indicated. This testing is based on clinical judgment. It does not require public health approval. Clinic administrators may need to contact commercial labs to set up testing protocols for their clinics.​

Healthcare providers may decide to have you first tested for other illnesses, like the flu, based on your possible exposure history and any other symptoms you might have. 
Individuals who feel very ill should seek appropriate care. 
If it is an emergency, call 911. If it is not an emergency but you feel sick
enough to need a medical appointment, call your doctor’s office. If you don’t
have a doctor, call 211 for a list of clinics near you. If necessary, visit
your local urgent care center.
Call before you go. If you have flu-like symptoms or have reason to think you might have COVID-19, let your healthcare provider know before you visit. This will help avoid exposing anyone else at the provider’s facility."

More
hospitals and commercial laboratories are performing COVID-19 testing; 
The
Oregon State Public Health Laboratory (OSPHL) is adding groups of people it can
test for COVID-19; 
There
are more types of testing available for COVID-19.
Oregon’s testing priorities are as follows:
Test
every Oregonian who is symptomatic even if the symptom is mild. 
Test
asymptomatic individuals in group living situations where COVID-19 is suspected
such as nursing homes, adult foster homes, group homes, farmworker housing,
fishing boats, prisons, and more. 
Conduct
widespread, voluntary sample testing, particularly for at-risk populations. 
Active
and timely contact tracing.
Centralize operations and coordination of testing.

It is also important to keep your body resilient:
Eat a healthy diet.
Exercise.
Get plenty of rest.
Stay up-to-date on routine vaccines. This includes the flu
vaccine. It is not too late to get a flu shot to protect yourself from the flu,
which continues to cause illness in Oregon.
Quit smoking and
     vaping. Initial research shows that people who smoke may be more likely to

Health care providers are encouraged to order a test for any child or adult who is showing symptoms of COVID-19, even if their symptoms are mild.
We ramping up our testing capabilities to conduct 1,000 tests a day â or 7,000 tests a week. We know that with increased testing we are likely to see a rise in positive cases, and we are prepared to handle such a scenario. A new Testing and Tracing Task Force has been created to guide and oversee this process.
Testing is currently available for:


Any adult or child with symptoms of COVID-19 â even if their symptoms are mild â who has been referred for testing by their doctor.


Long-term care facilities and other group living settings:

All residents and staff in group living settings, where there has been a single positive test. This includes nursing homes, assisted living facilities, prisons, and certain high-density residential buildings.
If there is a person who has tested positive with COVID-19 at a skilled nursing facility, they can be retested at 3 days, 7 days, 10 days and 14 days after the initial test. This is to help prevent community-wide outbreaks.
*For all sites, regardless of whether a person has tested positive, testing is offered at intake, discharge, and for certain residents who require regular care outside of the facility.



Staff at correctional facilities


Any Vermonter without symptoms can be tested at a pop-up site without a doctorâs referral, but registration for testing is required. Regular test collection locations still require a doctorâs referral.

The following groups are encouraged to get tested at these sites: health care workers, first responders (EMS, fire, and law enforcement), child care providers currently serving essential workers, and anyone currently under quarantine who has had no symptoms during the first seven days of quarantine.

"Serologic testing measures antibodies in the blood of a person who has been infected with COVID-19, whether they felt sick or not. In other words, it measures the bodyâs immune response to the virus, but does not detect the virus itself. According to the FDA, in the early days of an infection when the bodyâs immune response is still building, antibodies may not be detected. This limits the testâs effectiveness for diagnosing COVID-19 and why it should not be used as the sole basis to diagnose COVID-19.
With any test, there is always a risk of incorrect test results â false positive and false negative results. We need a good and accurate test we can rely on. The Vermont Department of Health convened a working group of experts to research antibody tests. Their findings conclude that at this time, the serologic (antibody) tests that are currently available are not accurate or reliable enough. Based on these findings, they caution against using serologic testing to make decisions about individuals. For example, using this test to establish âproof of immunity.â However, this type of test could help us better understand the population-level rate of infection from COVID-19 in Vermont.
We will continue to use public health best practice â considering clinical data, exposure history, and what is happening at the community-level â to make decisions on when to reopen businesses and when to return to work. The working group will continue to meet regularly and will be watching closely for changes and improvements in serologic testing. Recommendations may change based on new data."

"According to the CDC, at this time, there is no evidence that animals play a large role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19, and no evidence that the COVID-19 virus can spread to people from the skin, fur or hair of pets. Based on the limited information available at this time, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. A small number of pets have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after contact with people with COVID-19.
Pets have other types of coronaviruses that can make them sick, like canine and feline coronaviruses. These other coronaviruses cannot infect people and are not related to the current COVID-19 pandemic.
However, since animals can spread other diseases to people, itâs always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene. Find more information on staying safe and healthy around animals including pets from the CDC.

"Contact tracing is a strategy used to determine the source of an infection and how it is spreading. Finding people who are close contacts to a person who has tested positive for COVID-19, and therefore at higher risk of becoming infected themselves, can help prevent further spread of the virus.
A team of callers tries to reach anyone who has tested positive for COVID-19. They ask the patient questions about their activities within a certain timeframe â to help identify anyone they had close contact with. (Close contact means being closer than six feet apart for a long time while the person was infectious.) Those contacts might include family members, co-workers or health care providers. Please note, the Health Department only uses a live person for contact tracing and never uses anything that sounds like a âroboâ (computer-generated voice) call.
The team then gets in touch with those contacts and provides health guidance on what to do if you are a close contact of someone who is diagnosed with COVID-19. A close contact is asked to stay home for 14 days and watch for symptoms.
While we have been successful in contact tracing, we will continue to add resources and personnel needed to address any increase in the number of people who test positive, which we expect to happen with more testing. This includes the use of technology to help in these efforts. We will be using an app called SARA Alert, a secure monitoring and reporting system for public health that is being used in other states. This system will allow us to offer people who have tested positive for COVID-19, and their close contacts, to enroll in a text-based system to help us keep in touch and monitor their symptoms.
As the state reopens, Vermonters should consider keeping a contact journal â a list of other people who you have been in close contact with each day. If you do get sick, this would make it easier to get in touch with those people and so they can take proper precautions to prevent further spread of COVID-19."

"Making sure neighbors have what they need is crucial, but we need to make sure helpers and volunteers are still taking precautions to protect our most vulnerable Vermonters. Common sense practices can go a long way while Vermonters take care of each other.
The Vermont Department of Health recommends any volunteers bringing items to those who need to stay home:


Keep a distance of 6 feet away.


Avoid entering the personâs home.


Wear a cloth face mask or covering.


Wash your hands regularly.


Avoid touching your face and cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.


Stop doing community support work immediately if you feel sick or find out you have had contact with someone who is sick.


Keep a list of anyone you come into close contact with in case contact tracing is required.


Wear clean gloves when handling items that may be given to people with a weaker immune system, and when you are close to someone who may be sick."

As part of Governor Scottâs Work Smart & Stay Safe - Restart VT: Phase 3, people are required to wear cloth face masks or coverings over their nose and mouth when using public transportationâincluding buses, trains and ride services, and in mass transportation stations or terminals, including airports. Additionally, businesses and non-profit and government organizations may require customers or clients to wear cloth face masks or coverings.
The advice to wear cloth face masks or coverings is based on data about how COVID-19 can spread before a person has any symptoms. Because people may have COVID-19 but no symptoms, wearing cloth face masks or coverings may help keep people from spreading the virus.
We all still need to stay at least 6 feet away from people, even when wearing cloth face masks or coverings, practice good hand hygiene and follow the stateâs Stay Home, Stay Safe guidance.
The cloth face mask or covering must be worn properly to be effective and avoid the spread of germs:


Wash your hands before putting it on.


Be sure your mouth and nose are covered.


Hook loops around your ears or tie it snugly.


Do not touch it or pull it down while in public.


Keep it on until you get home.


Remove it without touching your eyes, nose or mouth, then wash your hands immediately.


Wash it and make sure itâs completely dry before using again. Have a few on hand so you can rotate for washing.


Some people should never wear a cloth face mask or covering, including:


Children under the age of 2


Anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious


Anyone who is unable to remove it without assistance


Medical-grade mask supplies are needed for our health care workers and first responders. Please use cloth face masks or coverings for your yourself and loved ones.
If you feel sick, stay home to rest and avoid going out into public places. If you are sick and plan to see a doctor, you should call the office before your visit.

"Close contact means being within 6 feet, for a long time, of someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 during their infectious period, which starts two days (48 hours) before any symptoms began and continues until they are recovered. Close contact does not mean being more than 6 feet away in the same indoor environment for a long period of time, walking by, or briefly being in the same room with someone.
A âlong period of timeâ is hard to define because it depends on whether the person was sick at the time and what type of interaction you had with that person. These examples can help you determine whether you were a close contact or not.
Examples of close contacts:


You live in the same home.


You are intimate partners.


You rode in the same car while the person was infectious.


You had dinner together while the person was infectious.


Examples of not close contacts:


You were their cashier at the grocery store.


You are a pharmacist who gave the person medication.


You were in front of the person in line at the store.


You are a coworker who briefly walked by to ask a question.


A team at the Health Department works with people with COVID-19 to identify their close contacts. This is called contact tracing. The team assesses each close contact for their exposure risk and gives them health guidance and recommendations for self-isolation or other restrictions.
As the state reopens, Vermonters should consider keeping a contact journal â a list of other people who you have been in close contact with

Donât leave home, except to get medical care. Call ahead before visiting a health care provider or emergency department. Wear a cloth face mask or covering if you need to leave home for medical care


Most people with mild illness can recover at home. While there is no specific treatment for COVID-19, you should get plenty of rest, drink plenty of fluids, and take fever-reducing medication if needed.


Stay in a specific room in your home and use a separate bathroom, as much as possible. Stay at least 6 feet away from others in your home at all times and wear a cloth face mask or covering if you are in the same room with them. Donât share household items.


Have someone else care for your pets.

Daily cleaning and washing:


Clean and disinfect surfaces in your separate room and bathroom. Have someone else clean the other areas of your home.

Cause
COVID-19: Caused by one virus, the novel 2019 coronavirus, now called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2.
Flu: Caused by any of several different types and strains of influenza viruses.
Transmission
While both the flu and COVID-19 may be transmitted in similar ways, there is also a possible difference: COVID-19 might be spread through the airborne route, meaning that tiny droplets remaining in the air could cause disease in others even after the ill person is no longer near.
Antiviral Medications
COVID-19: Antiviral medications are currently being tested to see if they can address symptoms.
Flu: Antiviral medications can address symptoms and sometimes shorten the duration of the illness.
Vaccine
COVID-19: No vaccine is available at this time, though it is in progress.
Flu: A vaccine is available and effective to prevent some of the most dangerous types or to reduce the severity of the flu.

"Plan ways to care for those in your home who might be at greater risk for serious complications, like older adults (65 years and older) and people of any age who have underlying medical conditions. Make sure those who need regular medicine, medical supplies and equipment have what they need.


Choose a room in your home that can be used to separate sick household members from those who are healthy. Identify a separate bathroom for the sick person to use, if possible. Plan to clean these rooms, as needed, when someone is sick.


Make sure you have enough groceries and other supplies for 14 days in case you get sick and need to quarantine. Stock up on only what you will need for 14 days. Do not buy more than you will need so you can leave supplies for other people.


Get support from others. Talk with your neighbors about emergency planning. If your neighborhood has Front Porch Forum, consider joining to connect with neighbors, information and resources. Stay in touch by phone or email with family and friends, especially those who are 65 years and older, who have underlying medical conditions, or who live alone.


Take care of the emotional health of your household members. Outbreaks can be stressful for adults and children. Talk with your children about the outbreak, try to stay calm, and reassure them that they are safe.


Keep a daily list of other people you are in close contact with. As the state reopens, Vermonters should consider keeping a contact journal. If you do get sick, this would make it easier to get in touch with those people and so they can take proper precautions to prevent further spread of COVID-19.

Members of one household may choose to socialize â and allow children to play â with members of another trusted household, such as family, neighbors or friends. A trusted household is one that has taken seriously the importance of social distancing and proper hygiene in their day-to-day lives. By carefully limiting these closer social interactions at this time it will be easier to identify who else may have been exposed and need to self-isolate in case someone becomes sick.
To keep COVID-19 from spreading, we must continue to:


Stay home and away from others if you are sick with COVID-19, have recently been exposed to someone who has COVID-19, or just donât feel well.


Keep a 6-foot distance from others when you meet people outside of your household.


Wash your hands frequently (hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol is acceptable when soap and water are not available).


Cough and sneeze into your elbow (even if you are wearing a cloth face mask or covering).

You are tested on Day 7 or later;
You remain in quarantine until the result comes back; AND
You receive a negative test result and are still not having symptoms.

For anyone coming into Vermont, Day 1 is the day after you arrive in Vermont.
However, if you end your quarantine period before 14 days, you must continue to monitor yourself for symptoms for the full 14 days.

If you are able to completely physically separate from the person who tested positive â for example you do not live in the same home â Day 1 of your quarantine is the day after the last time you were in close contact with them.

The Health Department recommends that towns do routine weekly E. coli testing and after large storm events during the swim season. These tests are a good indication of the water quality, meaning that if the E. coli levels are low, then COVID-19 virus levels are also expected to be low.

"Yes, people can continue to use reusable grocery bags. However, some stores are choosing to no longer allow reusable bags and containers at this time. Check with your local store for their current policies.
After July 1, stores and food service establishments will no longer provide plastic bags at check-out. Youâll have the option to purchase paper bags for 10 cents each or use reusable bags. If a store has temporarily banned reusable bags, consider putting your groceries back into your cart and bag them at your car. Some stores and food establishments may still offer plastic bags after July 1 since they are allowed to use the ones they currently have in stock until they are gone.
Current evidence suggests that the COVID-19 virus may live for hours to days on surfaces made from a variety of materials. It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. It is important to remember to wash your hands before you eat and to avoid touching your face.
Make sure you clean your reusable bags regularly, which can also help prevent illnesses from bacteria, such as E.coli, that are from meat and unwashed fruits and vegetables.

People who have trouble breathing can wear a light-weight bandanna or cloth covering tied to be open at the bottom or a face shield. Face shields are generally not recommended because they are more for health care settings to protect the person wearing it from droplets getting into their eyes. Face masks or coverings, like a cloth face mask or bandanna, do a better job than face shields of keeping droplets in. However, if your work environment or health does not allow you to wear a cloth face mask, wearing a face shield is better than having no barrier on your nose and mouth.

There have been a few confirmed cases of animals infected with COVID-19:

two pet cats in New York
a cat in Minnesota
aÂ dog in New York

The CDC recommends the following:
Until we learn more about how this virus affects animals, treat pets as you would other human family members to protect them from a possible infection.
Because there is a small risk that people with COVID-19 could spread the virus to animals, CDC recommends that pet owners limit their petâs interaction with people outside their household.

Keep cats indoors when possible and do not let them roam freely outside.
Walk dogs on a leash at least 6 feet away from others.
Avoid public places where large numbers of people gather.
Do not put face coverings on pets. Covering a petâs face could harm them.

"Under the Governorâs executive order extension â Be Smart, Stay Safe â Vermonters are encouraged to limit their exposure to the COVID-19 virus outside their homes as much as possible.
Vermonters should travel only as needed:

For personal safety, medical care and care of others
For work, although all workers should continue to work remotely whenever possible
For shopping and services available at all businesses and non-profit and government entities determined to be critical and those which have been authorized to resume operations
To get fresh air and exercise by taking advantage of outdoor recreation and outdoor fitness activities that require low or no direct physical contact
For limited social interactions and gatherings of 25 or fewer, preferably in outdoor settings
For in-state stays at available lodging, campground and marina facilities

Vermonters should follow health and safety precautions to help keep the virus from spreading by:

Staying home and away from others if you are sick with COVID-19, have recently been exposed to someone who has COVID-19, or just donât feel well.
Keeping a physical distance of at least 6 feet away from others (except for those you live with).
Washing or sanitizing your hands often.
Wearing a cloth face mask or covering in public settings when a physical distance of at least 6 feet is difficult to maintain (for example, at a grocery store or on a crowded sidewalk or bike path).
Coughing and sneezing into your elbow (even when wearing a face covering).
Limiting travel to within Vermont to the extent possible and when you do travel, limit non-essential stops.

Older adults (age 65 and over), and people with underlying medical conditions, like heart and lung disease or diabetes, are more likely to develop severe illness. They should take extra precautions.
Learn how to safely connect with friends and family. These recommended practices will help you weigh the risk and plan accordingly.

Pop-up Testing Sites and Pharmacy Testing Locations
Any person without symptoms who lives or works in Vermont can be tested at no cost at a pop-up testing site without a doctorâs referral. This includes people who live in a neighboring state and work in Vermont, second homeowners, and college students. Children under 12 months cannot be tested at a pop-up testing site. Please talk to your childâs doctor about testing options. Registration for testing is required. For people who do not have internet access and want to register at a pop-up site, they can call 2-1-1 for help with registration.
Some pharmacies may offer testing at no cost for people without symptoms. Call the pharmacy first to see if testing is offered and to schedule an appointment.
Register for a pop-up testing site.
For pop-up testing site registration questions and issues, call 802-828-2828. If you need transportation to a pop-up testing site, please call 833-387-7200 at least two days before your scheduled appointment.
The test is a nasopharyngeal swab, or NP swab, where a health care professional uses a swab to collect a sample from the back of the nose and throat. This test will tell you if you have a current infection. It is not a serology/antibody test, which means it will not tell you if you were infected in the past.

"The CDC issued a recommendation that testing should be occurring at a particular rate per 100,000 people. This is so we can see if the case numbers start to grow again as the state reopens. In Vermont, to achieve that rate, we need to test about 1,000 people per day.
As we test more and more people without symptoms, we are finding fewer and fewer cases. Early on, we only tested people who were very, very ill. Even then, a vast majority did not have COVID-19. Over time we started to test people who were moderately ill, then with mild symptoms, and now we also can include people who do not have symptoms.
Testing helps us better understand the current rate of active infections of COVID-19 in Vermont, and helps to contain and slow the spread to others. It also lets us see how that rate is changing over time as we slowly reopen the state."

Is it safe to go for a walk or exercise outside if someone jogs or bikes past me?	"Coronavirus cannot travel very far in the air, the World Health Organization says.
The virus is mainly spread through small droplets from an infected person’s nose or mouth, which get released when a person coughs, sneezes or speaks. 
These droplets “are relatively heavy, do not travel far and quickly sink to the ground,” the WHO said. 
While the wind isn’t a big risk factor, contaminated surfaces are. Those respiratory droplets can land on surfaces such as tables, doorknobs and handrails — and subsequently infect others who touch those surfaces and later touch their eyes, nose or mouth. 
That’s why wearing a face mask won’t necessarily protect you from coronavirus. The primary benefit of wearing a mask is to protect others if you’re sick or an asymptomatic carrier of the virus."

Why practice social distancing now, when we didn’t during the SARS and swine flu epidemics?	"Unlike SARS and swine flu, the novel coronavirus is both highly contagious and especially deadly, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said. 
“SARS was also a coronavirus, and it was a new virus at the time,” Gupta said. “In the end, we know that SARS ended up infecting 8,000 people around the world and causing around 800 deaths. So very high fatality rate, but it didn’t turn out to be very contagious.”
The swine flu, or H1N1, “was very contagious and infected some 60 million people in the United States alone within a year,” Gupta said. “But it was far less lethal than the flu even — like 1/3 as lethal as the flu.” 
What makes the novel coronavirus different is that “this is both very contagious … and it appears to be far more lethal than the flu as well,” Gupta said. “So both those things, in combination I think, are why we’re taking this so seriously.”"

"Singapore was initially praised for its clampdown on the virus. Even people who had no symptoms but tested positive had to be hospitalized until they tested negative. 
But Singapore was also relaxed, allowing businesses, churches, restaurants and schools to stay open during its first wave of the virus. And some communities were overlooked by government testing.
The number of cases in Singapore shot up, and the country suffered a strong second wave of coronavirus. 
By contrast, Germany, South Korea, Iceland and Taiwan have been able to suppress the virus. They also have among the lowest death rates from Covid-19 in the world. 
Taiwan was proactive, launching its Central Epidemic Command Center before the island even confirmed its first infection. 
Iceland required all its citizens returning to the country to undergo 14 days of quarantine – regardless of which country they traveled from.
Germany and South Korea quickly launched widespread testing and have some of the highest per-capita testing rates in the world. Their ability to identify and isolate those infected has helped prevent deadlier outcomes."

“Vaping affects your lungs at every level. It affects the immune function in your nasal cavity by affecting cilia, which push foreign things out,” said Prof. Stanton Glantz, director of the Center for Tobacco Research Control and Education at University of California San Francisco.
When you vape, “the ability of your upper airways to clear viruses is compromised,” Glantz said.
Tobacco smokers are at especially high risk. In a study from China, where the first Covid-19 outbreak occurred, smokers were 14 times more likely to develop severe complications than non-smokers.
Even occasionally smoking marijuana can put you at greater risk.
“What happens to your airways when you smoke cannabis is that it causes some degree of inflammation, very similar to bronchitis, very similar to the type of inflammation that cigarette smoking can cause,” said pulmonologist Dr. Albert Rizzo, chief medical officer for the American Lung Association.
“Now you have some airway inflammation, and you get an infection on top of it. So yes, your chance of getting more complications is there.”"

“I just want to make sure everybody knows that no matter what their age is, it can seriously affect them. And it can seriously mess them up, like it messed me up,” the Iowa teen said. 
He started feeling sick on St. Patrick’s Day, with just a small cough. “I thought at first it was just a normal cold. And then it started progressively getting worse,” he said.

If so, how do I make one?	"The CDC recently changed its guidance on wearing face masks as more studies about asymptomatic spread pile up.
Now, the CDC “recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies).”
But there are several important caveats and key points: 

The public should NOT buy surgical masks or N95 respirator masks. Those are desperately needed by health care workers who are in close contact with coronavirus patients every day. 
Instead, make your own cloth mask — it’s easy, and you don’t have to sew. US Surgeon General Jerome Adams shows how to make face masks with just a T-shirt and rubber bands in this CDC video. You can also use a bandana and a coffee filter. 
Don’t be fooled: The main benefit of wearing masks in public isn’t to protect you from getting sick. Rather, it’s to protect others from yourself if you’re sick or you’re an asymptomatic carrier. “This is more for people who might be infected and don’t know it, and to try and lower the likelihood that they will spread this to somebody else,” CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said. The CDC agreed.
You can definitely still get coronavirus even if you wear a mask. The virus can stay alive on surfaces for up to 3 days, and it’s easy to touch your face whenever you’re not wearing a mask. Also, people often adjust face masks frequently, leading to more touching of the face — a common way that coronavirus spreads.
It’s important to wash your cloth mask after every use. Here’s how. 
Wearing cloth masks is just “an additional, voluntary public health measure,” the CDC said. To protect yourself from getting coronavirus, it’s critical to stay 6 feet away from others, wash your hands frequently for at least 20 seconds each time, and stop touching your face."

Research by the Imperial College in Great Britain “would suggest you have to institute these kinds of measures for five months, very vigorously,” said Dr. Celine Gounder, an infectious disease specialist at Bellevue Hospital Center. 
“And then you may be able to relax for a period. And then you would re-institute as the cases go up again. But we’re basically looking at doing this over and over and over again, even after a five-month period of strict social distancing, in order to curb cases until we have a vaccine.”

Some have resorted to using plastic report covers as masks. The CDC said medical providers might have to use expired masks or reuse them between multiple patients. (This shortage is why the general public should not buy medical masks and instead make cloth masks at home.)
But it’s not just subpar protective gear that puts medical workers at risk. It’s also the amount of virus they’re exposed to. 
“The viral load — the amount of virus – does determine the severity of your illness,” emergency room physician Dr. Leana Wen said. “So that could happen in the case of health care workers who are exposed to a lot more Covid-19 as a result of their work — that they get more severely ill.”"

In mid-March, the CDC said almost half of the 712 people with coronavirus who were on the Diamond Princess cruise ship didn’t have any symptoms when they tested positive.
And recent studies suggest 25% to 50% of coronavirus carriers don’t have symptoms.
In the US, “I think it could be as many as 1 in 3 walking around asymptomatic,” said New Jersey primary care physician Dr. Alex Salerno.
“We have tested some patients that have known exposure to COVID (coronavirus disease). They did not have temperature. Their pulse/(oxygen) was OK.”
Aside from social distancing and frequent hand washing, Salerno said more testing of people without symptoms is essential.
When asymptomatic carriers test positive, “we isolate them, and we separate them from the people who are not positive,” Salerno said. If more asymptomatic people got tested, “we could get people back to work safely.”
But there haven’t been nearly enough tests in the US for everyone who wants one, due to shortages, delays and faulty test kits."

“The necessary temperature would also be based on the materials of the surface, the environment, etc.”
President Donald Trump suggested this coronavirus could subside by the warmer summer months, but scientists say it’s too early to tell. And the fact that coronavirus keeps spreading in the Southern Hemisphere during its summer months suggests this strain might not succumb to warmer temperatures. 
“The short answer is that while we may expect modest declines in the contagiousness of (novel coronavirus) in warmer, wetter weather … it is not reasonable to expect these declines alone to slow transmission enough to make a big dent,” wrote Dr. Marc Lipsitch, director of the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics at Harvard’s T.H.

Back then, hospitals often had empty hospital beds for new patients. But now, many hospitals are “absolutely full,” Schaffner said. “We have under-built hospital beds because they are very expensive.”
Also, Americans have grown accustomed to “just-in-time” ordering. But that becomes a huge problem when international supply chains are disrupted by an outbreak. “We didn’t anticipate international turbulence influencing this,” Schaffner said.

In the first few weeks of the outbreak in the US, the CDC was the only facility in the country that could confirm test results — even though a World Health Organization test became available around the same time. 
Some test kits that were sent around the country were flawed — a move that put the US behind about “four to five weeks,” says Dr. Rob Davidson, executive director of the Committee to Protect Medicare."

"No, antibiotics are not effective against coronavirus because the disease is a viral infection, not a bacterial infection. 
“However, if you are hospitalized for the [coronavirus], you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible,” the World Health Organization says. 
There is no known cure for the coronavirus. Researchers are studying whether the antiviral drug remdesivir might work, but testing of that drug just started.
For now, coronavirus patients get “supportive” treatment, “which means giving fluids, medicine to reduce fever, and, in severe cases, supplemental oxygen,” the Harvard Medical School says."

"No. There are some interesting coincidences in the 1981 fiction novel, which says “a severe pneumonia-like illness will spread around the globe” around the year 2020. Modern editions of the book call the biological strain “Wuhan-400,” and the current coronavirus outbreak started in Wuhan, China.
But there are important differences between the book and reality. The original version of the book called the strain the “Gorki-400,” in reference to a Russian locality, before it was later changed to the “Wuhan-400.” In the book, the virus was man-made, while scientists believe the novel coronavirus started in animals and jumped to humans. And in the book, the virus had a 100% mortality rate. Early estimates of the mortality rate for this coronavirus outbreak range from 2-4%."

"Convalescent plasma is the liquid part of blood from patients who have recovered from an infection, the US Food and Drug Administration says. “Antibodies present in convalescent plasma are proteins that might help fight the infection.”
But just like with normal blood donation, donors and recipients must be matched by blood type. Type AB plasma is the only universal type and can be given to patients of any blood type. 
The FDA said patients who are fully recovered from Covid-19 for at least two weeks are encouraged to consider donating plasma.
The Red Cross said there are other requirements for plasma donors: 

You are at least 17 years old and weigh at least 110 pounds. (The age requirement may differ according to organization and state). Other weight requirements apply for donors age 18 or younger.
You must be in good health overall health now.

Vinetz said cloth masks can be washed and reused, and even disposable masks can be reused if you let them sit for several days. 
To disinfect masks that you can’t wash, Vinetz recommends leaving them in a clean, safe place in your home for a few days. After that, it should no longer be infectious, as this coronavirus is known to survive on hard surfaces for only up to three days."

Should I wash my hair every day?	"Coronavirus can stick to hair, said Dr. David Aronoff, director of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. 
Touching contaminated hair and then touching your mouth, eyes or nose could increase your risk of infection. “Like on the skin, this coronavirus is a transient hitchhiker that can be removed by washing,” Aronoff said.
But that doesn’t mean you have to wash the hair on your head multiple times a day, said dermatologist Dr. Hadley King. 
That’s because “living hair attached to our scalps may be better protected by our natural oils that have some antimicrobial properties and may limit how well microbes can attach to the hair,” she said. 
“If you are going out into areas that could possibly be contaminated with viral particles, then it would be reasonable to wash the hair daily during the pandemic. But it’s not the same as hand washing – the virus infects us through our mucosal surfaces.  If your hair is not falling into your face or you’re not running your fingers through it, then there is less of a risk.”
If your hair does fall into your face, you may want to pull it back to minimize your risk, King said.
As for facial hair, “washing at least daily if not more frequently is wise, depending on how often they touch their face,” Aronoff said."

“They call that the pre-symptomatic period. So people tend to have more virus at that point seemingly in their nose, in their mouth. This is even before they get sick. And they can be shedding that virus into the environment.”
Some people infected with coronavirus never get symptoms. But it’s easy for these asymptomatic carriers to infect others, said Dr. Anne Rimoin, an epidemiology professor at UCLA’s School of Public Health.
“When you speak, sometimes you’ll spit a little bit,” she said. “You’ll rub your nose. You’ll touch your mouth. You’ll rub your eyes. And then you’ll touch other surfaces, and then you will be spreading virus if you are infected and shedding asymptomatically.”

"There have been some reports of animals infected by coronavirus — including two pets in New York and eight big cats at the Bronx Zoo. 
Most of those infections came from contact with people who had coronavirus, like a zoo employee who was an asymptomatic carrier. 
But according to the CDC, there is no evidence animals play a significant role in spreading the virus to humans. Therefore, at this time, routine testing of animals for Covid-19 is not recommended.
As always, it’s best to wash your hands after touching an animal’s fur and before touching your face. And if your pet appears to be sick, call your veterinarian."

If I don’t have disinfecting wipes, can I use soap and water on surfaces?	"Yes, you can use soap and water on surfaces just like you would on your hands to kill coronavirus. But don’t use water alone — that won’t really help. 
The outer layer of the virus is made up of lipids, aka fat. Your goal is to break through that fatty barrier, forcing the virus’ guts to spill out and rendering it dead. 
In other words, imagine coronavirus is a butter dish that you’re trying to clean. 
“You try to wash your butter dish with water alone, but that butter is not coming off the dish,” said Dr. John Williams, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh. 
“You need some soap to dissolve grease. So soap or alcohol are very, very effective against dissolving that greasy liquid coating of the virus.”
By cutting through the greasy barrier, Williams said, “it physically inactivates the virus so it can’t bind to and enter human cells anymore.”"

How do I protect children who crawl or play on the floor?	"Yes, coronavirus can live on the soles of shoes, but the risk of getting Covid-19 from shoes appears to be low.
A report published by the CDC highlighted a study from a hospital in Wuhan, China, where this coronavirus outbreak began. 
The soles of medical workers’ shoes were swabbed and analyzed, and the study found that the virus was “widely distributed” on floors, computer mice, trash cans and door knobs. But it’s important to note the study was done in a hospital, where the virus was concentrated. 
It’s still possible to pick up coronavirus on the bottoms of your shoes by running errands, but it’s unlikely you’ll get sick from it because people don’t often touch the soles of their shoes and then their faces. Because Covid-19 is a respiratory disease, the CDC advises wearing a mask while in public and washing your hands frequently– the correct way. 
If you have small children who crawl or regularly touch the floor, it’s a good idea to take your shoes off as soon you get home to prevent coronavirus or bacteria from spreading on the floors."

“Coronaviruses are named for the crown-like spikes on their surface,” or coronas, the CDC says. The scientific name for this novel coronavirus is SARS-CoV-2, which stands for “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.”
Covid-19, however, is the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. The letters and numbers in “Covid-19” come from “Coronavirus disease 2019.”"

In other words, coronavirus isn’t just killing more people than the flu. It’s also killing at a much faster rate.
From October 1 to April 4, an estimated 24,000 to 62,000 Americans died from the flu, according to CDC. 
The first known US death from coronavirus was in February. By May 13, more than 83,600 people have died, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
There are other reasons why coronavirus can be more dangerous than the flu:

Coronavirus is twice as contagious as the flu. Research indicates a person with the flu infects an average of 1.28 other people, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said. But with coronavirus, “it’s likely between 2 and 3” other people. But mitigation efforts such as stay-at-home orders can drastically reduce that number. 
Coronavirus can be spread unknowingly for many more days than the flu. People with coronavirus might not get symptoms for 14 days, and some get no symptoms at all. But during that time, they’re still contagious and can infect others unknowingly. But the incubation period for the flu is much shorter, and most people get symptoms within two days of infection.
A vaccine is available for the flu, but no vaccine is available for coronavirus. Experts say the number of flu deaths could be drastically reduced if more people got their flu shots. But about half of Americans don’t get vaccinated, including most children who die from the flu."

Warm water is perfectly fine for washing your hands — as long as you wash them thoroughly (like this) and for at least 20 seconds. (To time yourself, you can hum the “Happy Birthday” song twice or sing a couple of verses from any of these hit songs from the past several decades.)
Cold water will also work, “but you have to make sure you work really vigorously to get a lather and get everything soapy and bubbly,” said chemist Bill Wuest, an associate professor at Emory University. To do that, you might need to sing “Happy Birthday” three times instead of twice. 
“Warm water with soap gets a much better lather – more bubbles,” Wuest said. “It’s an indication that the soap is … trying to encapsulate the dirt and the bacteria and the viruses in them.”"

To ease their mask fears, try buying or making masks with fun designs on them. Or have your child customize his or her own mask by drawing on them with markers.
You can also order children’s face masks with superheroes on them or show your kids photos of their favorite celebrities wearing masks.

Why should I wear one if I don’t feel sick?	"This coronavirus is notoriously easy to spread between people who don’t have any symptoms (yet). That could include you. 
An estimated 230,000 to 450,000 Covid-19 cases were prevented in states that required face mask use between April 8 and May 15, researchers from the University of Iowa found.
And the longer the rules were in place, the higher the reduction in new coronavirus cases. Within a week after implementing face mask rules, the researchers observed a 0.9% decline in new Covid-19 cases. After 21 days, that decrease more than doubled, to about 2%.
Another study published in the Lancet medical journal also said wearing a face mask decreases the chances of spreading coronavirus. 
But many people are skipping face masks as states reopen. That’s the opposite of what needs to happen, since many more people are out in public now, said Jeremy Howard, a research scientist at the University of San Francisco.

But it’s important to act quickly for CPR to be effective. 
“The chance of survival goes down by 10% for every minute without CPR,” said Dr. Comilla Sasson, vice president for science and innovation in emergency cardiovascular care at the American Heart Association. “It’s a 10-minute window to death in many cases.”
If you’re not certified in CPR, performing chest compressions could also buy more time until help arrives. Bystanders should “provide high-quality chest compressions by pushing hard and fast in the middle of the victim’s chest, with minimal interruptions,” the American Heart Association said. 
If you’re not sure how “fast” to do to those chest compressions, singing any of these popular songs will help you get the right rhythm."

“Properly maintained pool water will not be a source of spread of the virus. The chlorine that’s in it will inactivate the virus fairly quickly,” immunologist Erin Bromage said. 
“The level of dilution that would happen in a pool or an ocean or a large freshwater body would not lead to enough virus to establish an infection. But when you do this, you need to just make sure that we’re maintaining an appropriate physical distance while swimming or sitting in a hot tub.” 
That’s because it’s easy for infected people with no symptoms to spread the virus if they’re within 6 feet from each other. If you have an indoor pool or hot tub, even 6 feet might not be enough distance."

“This type of spread is not a concern after death,” the CDC said. But it cautions that “we are still learning how it spreads.”
“There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing,” the CDC said. 
“Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible.”
If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, “families are encouraged to work with their community’s cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible,” the CDC said.
“At a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves. If splashing of fluids is expected, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required (such as disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N-95 respirator).”

Hand sanitizers “need to have at least 60% alcohol in them,” said Dr. William Schaffner, professor of preventative medicine and infectious disease at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. 
And don’t just put a little dollop in your hand and smear it around quickly. 
“You’ve got to use enough and get it all over the surfaces,” Schaffner said. “Rub it all over your hands, between your fingers and on the back of your hands.”

So how do you protect yourself? To avoid touching cash or coins, use contactless methods of payment whenever possible, Wen said.
If you can’t use a contactless form of payment, credit cards and debit cards are much easier to clean and disinfect than cash. But remember that anyone who touches your credit card can also leave germs on it.
If you must use cash, “wash your hands well with soap and water” afterward, Wen said. 
The same applies for anything else you touch that might have coronavirus on it. If you can’t wash your hands immediately, use hand sanitzier or disinfectant.

"“Theoretically, it’s possible, but we have no proof of that,” said Dr. Thomas Steinemann, a clinical spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology.
Dr. William Schaffner, a professor at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, said he’s skeptical.
“It’s possible, I guess, but I’ve always thought that that was a bit of a stretch,” Schaffner said. 
That doesn’t mean you should start rubbing your eyes. While you might not get Covid-19 from your eyes, this new coronavirus could cause conjunctivitis – a highly contagious condition better known as pink eye. 
But there are lots of possible causes of pink eye, including other viruses, bacteria, fungi, styes and even allergies."

Why don’t we do that in the US?	"Randomly spraying open places is largely a waste of time, health experts say. 
It can actually do more harm than good. “Spraying disinfectants can result in risks to the eyes, respiratory or skin irritation,” the World Health Organization said.
“Spraying or fumigation of outdoor spaces, such as streets or marketplaces, is also not recommended to kill the COVID-19 virus or other pathogens because disinfectant is inactivated by dirt and debris, and it is not feasible to manually clean and remove all organic matter from such spaces,” the WHO said.
“Moreover, spraying porous surfaces, such as sidewalks and unpaved walkways, would be even less effective.” Besides, the ground isn’t typically a source of infection, the WHO said.
And once the disinfectant wears off, an infected person could easily contaminate the surface again."

"While some UV light devices are used for hospital disinfection, UV light only kills germs under very specific conditions — including certain irradiation dosages and exposure times, the World Health Organization said. 
But UV light can also damage the body. 
Two factors are required for UV light to destroy a virus: intensity and time. If the light is intense enough to break apart a virus in a short time, it’s going to be dangerous to people, said Donald Milton, a professor at the University of Maryland. 
UVA and UVB light both damage the skin. UVC light is safer for skin, but it will damage tender tissue such as the eyes.

Coronavirus often spreads more easily indoors rather than outdoors — especially if you’re indoors for an extended period of time. 
Researchers have also found that heavy breathing and singing can propel aerosolized viral particles farther and increase the risk of transmission. 
During one fitness instructor workshop, about 30 participants with no symptoms trained intensely for four hours, according to research published by the CDC. Eight participants later tested positive, and more than 100 new cases of coronavirus were traced back to that fitness workshop.
To help mitigate the risk, many gyms are now limiting capacity. Some are providing members with disinfectant sprays to sanitize equipment. 
While health experts have recommended staying 6 feet away from others, it’s smart to keep even more distance than that at the gym. 
“With all the heavy breathing, you may even want to double the usual 6 feet to 12 feet, just to be safe,” CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said."

Self-quarantine is staying in place, either at home or elsewhere, for fourteen days because you have been exposed to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Self-isolation would be isolating within the house after you start showing symptoms of COVID-19. Social distancing is a response in which people remain home and distant from others (such as by refraining from shaking hands or hugging or going to the store at off hours), without any known exposure to the virus, to limit possible transmission to or from others.

If you develop these symptoms, contact your medical provider but stay home as long as those symptoms are manageable (like you would for a normal cold or flu). If you have severe shortness of breath or if symptoms suddenly get worse, that is when you should seek out medical care.

If you can have a separate space for the sick person—a space where they can access the restroom without traveling through commons spaces—that would be best. Those who are caring for loved ones who are sick at home should wash their hands frequently, avoid close contact as much as possible, and have the sick individual wear a surgical or procedure mask to prevent droplets spreading through the air. It is also important to clean frequent- or high-touch surfaces, as well to clean clothes in very hot water. Caregivers should also wear a mask, if possible.

I think that's a tougher situation. It's very hard to stay away from kids, especially when they're ill and need care and comfort. If possible, main caregivers should be those who are not at high risk from COVID-19, meaning those not over age sixty or with underlying health issues. Other than that, it's important to take the normal precautions in terms of handwashing and cleaning, but it is much more difficult with children.

In general, it's important to keep the circle smaller. At the moment, not exposing yourself to many additional people is best. Healthcare workers, people with critical jobs, and hourly employees who have to work will need to rely on childcare providers. In those situations, you may ask someone you know and trust, and who is reliable in taking the social distancing rules seriously. If possible, childcare providers should not be in a group that's at high-risk for COVID.

As of April 19, the only pets incidentally exposed to COVID-19 that have tested positive, with confirmation, for SARS-CoV-2 are two pet dogs and a pet cat in Hong Kong. Another pet cat in Belgium tested positive, but details around that case are less clear.. In each case, the pet was in the care of and had close contact with a person who had been confirmed to have COVID-19. Only in the case of the cat in Belgium was there a suggestion of the animal showing clinical signs of disease and, in that case, other diseases and conditions that could have caused those same signs of illness were not ruled out and there are also questions about how samples demonstrating the presence of SARS-CoV-2 were collected and evaluated. That cat recovered.In a French study, tests (RT-PCR and antibody evaluation via an immunoprecipitation assay) performed on 21 pets (12 dogs and 9 cats) living in close contact with their 20 French veterinary student owners (2 of whom were confirmed to have COVID-19 infection and 11 more of whom showed symptoms consistent with COVID-19) all yielded negative results.Two commercial laboratories in the United States reported they have tested (RT-PCR) thousands of specimens from dogs and cats for SARS-CoV-2 and have obtained no positive results. These specimens have come from the United States, South Korea, Canada, and Europe, including regions concurrently experiencing human COVID-19 cases. While this is encouraging, the specimens tested were originally submitted for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of more common pathogens causing respiratory disease in dogs and cats and, as such, per-case information as to whether or not these dogs and cats had contact with confirmed COVID-19 positive people is not available.As of April 19, the CDC had not received any National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL)-confirmed reports of pets becoming sick with COVID-19 in the United States.Preliminary findings from limited laboratory experimental studies indicate that, of species tested thus far, cats are the species most susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2. Some cats in these studies developed signs of clinical disease. Ferrets were also found to be susceptible to infection, but appeared less likely to develop disease. In the laboratory setting cats and ferrets were also able to transmit SARS-CoV-2 to other cats and ferrets, respectively. Dogs appeared to be susceptible to infection, but less so than cats or ferrets. Other preliminary laboratory findings indicate that poultry and pigs are not susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2. It is important to understand that experimentally induced infection does not mirror naturally induced infection. In other words, just because an animal can be experimentally infected via inoculation with high concentrations of purified tissue-cultured virus does not mean that it will be easily be infected with that same virus under natural conditions. The number of animals involved in these studies was also very small and conclusions were drawn based on data that, in some cases, were collected from as few as two animals.There is no evidence to suggest that animals, including pets, that may be incidentally infected by humans are playing a role in the spread of COVID-19. Human outbreaks are driven by person-to-person transmission.Pets have other types of coronaviruses that can cause them to become ill, but these are species-specific, meaning that they do not infect people and are not related to the current COVID-19 outbreak.We will continue to provide you with information as we learn more about pets and SARS-COV-2. Because animals can spread other diseases to people and people can also spread diseases to animals, it’s a good idea to always wash your hands before and after interacting with and caring for your pets, as well as before and after handling their food, supplies, and waste.

Current clinical management includes the application of infection prevention and control measures, such as separating the patient from other people and pets in the home and aggressive hygiene and disinfection and supportive care, including supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilatory support when indicated. While researchers are studying new drugs and drugs that are already approved for other health conditions as possible treatments for COVID-19 (e.g., Remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, investigational antivirals, immunotherapeutics, host-directed therapies), currently there are no drugs that are specifically FDA-approved for treatment of this disease. The FDA is working with drug manufacturers, researchers, and other partners to accelerate the development and approval process for COVID-19 treatments. Information on registered clinical trials for COVID-19 in the United States is available at ClinicalTrials.gov. Interest has emerged regarding ivermectin as a potential treatment after Australian scientists demonstrated that a single dose eradicated all genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 growing in cell culture within 48 hours. Additional testing in animals and people is required to determine whether these in vitro results are mirrored in vivo and what dose might be effective in treating the virus, while still being safe to administer to people. There has been similar interest around the use of chloroquine phosphate after a publication was released suggesting some efficacy for its use in treating COVID-19-associated pneumonia in clinical studies. While used to treat malaria and certain other conditions in people, chloroquine phosphate is also available in a different formulation to treat disease in aquarium fish and at least one person has died from ingesting chloroquine phosphate in that formulation. Because ivermectin is also readily available in formulations used to treat animals, similar concerns exist around the misuse of this drug and FDA has issued a warning accordingly.While we are all anxious to find a treatment for COVID-19, it is very important that people not self-medicate with prescription medications or over-the-counter drugs that are not prescribed or recommended for them by their doctor for their particular health condition(s) and veterinarians should advise clients accordingly.

Onset and duration of viral shedding and the period of infectiousness for COVID-19 are not yet known. There are reports of asymptomatic infections (detection of virus with no development of corresponding symptoms) and pre-symptomatic infections (detection of virus prior to development of symptoms) with SARS-CoV-2, but their role in transmission is not yet known. Based on existing literature, the incubation period (detection of virus prior to development of symptoms) ranges from two to 14 days.
678	https://www.avma.org/sites/default/files/2020-03/covid-19-faq-pet-owners.pdf	AVMA	True	US	en	AVMA|||6166692271986395539	1589487189.15082	Q: How are respiratory droplets and contact with them related to SARS-CoV-2 exposure?	Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 most often occurs when a person infected with the virus releases droplets by coughing, sneezing, speaking, singing, or exhaling. These droplets are generally too heavy to hang in the air, and quickly fall onto floors or other surfaces. All else being equal, the stronger the exhale (coughing or sneezing as compared with normal exhalation) the more droplets are released and the farther the droplets may be dispersed. Taking this into account, many states have now adopted social distancing of 6 feet because virtually all sizes of droplets disperse short of that radius.Exhaled droplets eventually land somewhere; for example, on hands, shirt sleeves, countertops, and floors. Droplets can also land on or be transferred by touch to other often-touched surfaces, such as door handles, silver and dinnerware, keys, and steering wheels. Coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, have been shown to survive in the environment from a few hours to a few days, depending on the type of surface, temperature, humidity, and contact with ultraviolet light. Touching one’s mouth, nose, or eyes with SARS-CoV-2-contaminated hands after touching contaminated surfaces is a secondary route of exposure. Results of an experimental laboratory study suggest that detectable amounts of SARS-CoV-2 virus remain in the air, and on copper, cardboard, stainless steel, and plastic during favorable conditions for the virus (71 to 73°F) for three, four, 24, 72, and 72 hours, respectively. This study, however, involved a much larger viral load than might be expected after normal exposures so the retention times reported may be a worse-case scenario. Virus was also detected in a hospital room of a COVID-19 patient prior to routine cleaning, but no virus was detected after routine cleaning of that patient’s room.

SARS-CoV-2 is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person, including between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet [2 meters]), through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks. Some recent studies have suggested that COVID-19 may be spread by people who are not showing symptoms of the disease, so maintaining social distance (about 6 feet) is important to preventing the spread of COVID-19. It may be possible to contract COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching your mouth, nose, or possibly your eyes. While this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads, CDC recommends people practice frequent hand hygiene, which is either washing hands with soap or water or using an alcohol-based hand rub. CDC also recommends routine cleaning of frequently touched surfaces.

Was there an intermediate host?	The precise mechanism of evolution of SARS-CoV-2 from bats (if that is where SARS-CoV-2 came from) to people is not presently known. At least two scenarios have been proposed. The first has the virus evolving to its current pathogenicity through natural section in a non-human host (e.g., bat) and jumping to humans. There are no documented cases of bat to human transmission of a coronavirus; previous coronaviruses have passed through an intermediate mammal host before human infection. The identity of the SARS-CoV-2 intermediate host (if there is one) is also currently unknown, but several have been suggested including pangolins and stray dogs. In an alternative scenario, a nonpathogenic version of the virus would have jumped from an animal host to humans and then evolved within humans to its current pathogenic state. These are all hypotheses based on comparative analysis of RNA coronaviral sequences and none have been confirmed to date.

This is a hypothesis. The RNA sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to that of other coronaviruses circulating in bats in Southeast Asia. Taxonomically, SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus. Using molecular clock analysis, betacoronaviruses are reported to have originated about 3,300 BC. Bats are considered to be ideal hosts for alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses.Sars-CoV-2 viruses isolated from different human COVID-19 patients are reported to have almost identical sequences and the sequences are reported to be 88% and 89.1% analogous with bat-SL-CoVZC45, and 96% analogous with BatCoV RaTG13. BatCoV RaTG13 was previously detected in the horseshoe bat, which is found in South and Southeast Asia and southern and central China.

On April 3, quantitative PCR testing for SARS-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) on duplicate respiratory tract samples from a four-year-old female Malayan tiger with respiratory signs that was living at the Wildlife Conservation Society’s (WCS) Bronx Zoo was performed at the Animal Health Diagnostic Center and New York State Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory at Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine and the University of Illinois College of Veterinary Medicine Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. Presumptive positive results of that testing were confirmed by the USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratory on April 4. The tiger was one of two Malayan tigers, two Amur tigers, and three African lions that developed respiratory signs over the course of a week; respiratory signs included a dry cough and, in some cases, wheezing, but no dyspnea or nasal or ocular discharge. Mild anorexia was also noted in some animals. All of the large cats are long-term residents of the zoo, do not have chronic medical conditions, and there have been no new animals introduced to the groups for several years. All other Amur and Malayan tigers, a snow leopard, cheetah, clouded leopard, Amur leopard, puma (Puma concolor), and serval at the zoo still appear healthy. The source of infection was presumed to be transmission from a zookeeper, who at the time of exposure had not yet developed symptoms of COVID-19. The zoo has been closed to the public since mid-March, and the first tiger began showing signs of being ill on March 27. All of these large cats are expected to recover. Other animals in other parts of the zoo have shown no clinical signs of disease. Enhanced biosecurity protocols have been implemented for staff caring for all nondomestic felids in the four zoos overseen by the WCS.Because infection of animals with SARS-CoV-2 meets the criteria of an emerging disease, such cases are reported to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE).

What can you tell me about those reports?	Preliminary findings from limited laboratory experimental studies indicate that, of species tested thus far, cats are the species most susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2. Some cats in these studies developed signs of clinical disease. Ferrets were also found to be susceptible to infection, but appeared less likely to develop disease. In the laboratory setting cats and ferrets were also able to transmit SARS-CoV-2 to other cats and ferrets, respectively. Golden Syrian hamsters were also able to be experimentally infected and were able to spread the infection to other hamsters. Dogs appeared to be susceptible to infection, but less so than cats or ferrets. Other preliminary laboratory findings indicate that poultry and pigs are not susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2.It is important to understand that experimentally induced infection does not mirror naturally induced infection. In other words, just because an animal can be experimentally infected via inoculation with high concentrations of purified tissue-cultured virus does not mean that it will be easily be infected with that same virus under natural conditions. The number of animals involved in these studies was also very small and conclusions were drawn based on data that, in some cases, were collected from as few as two animals. There is no evidence to suggest that animals, including pets, that may be incidentally infected by humans are playing a role in the spread of COVID-19. Human outbreaks are driven by person-to-person transmission.

As of April 17, two commercial laboratories in the United States reported they had tested thousands of specimens from dogs and cats for SARS-CoV-2 and had obtained no positive results. These specimens have come from the United States, South Korea, Canada, and Europe, including regions concurrently experiencing human COVID-19 cases. While this is encouraging, the specimens tested were originally submitted for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of more common pathogens causing respiratory disease in dogs and cats and, as such, per-case information as to whether or not these dogs and cats had contact with confirmed COVID-19 positive people is not available.Only a few animals with a known history of exposure to people with confirmed COVID-19 have been tested. With that in mind, the only pets incidentally exposed to COVID-19 that have tested positive, with confirmation, for SARS-CoV-2 are two pet dogs and a pet cat in Hong Kong. Another pet cat in Belgium tested positive, but details around that case are less clear. In each case, the pet was in the care of and had close contact with a person who had been confirmed to have COVID-19. Only in the case of the cat in Belgium was there a suggestion of the animal showing clinical signs of disease and, in that case, other diseases and conditions that could have caused those same signs of illness were not ruled out and there are also questions about how samples demonstrating the presence of SARS-CoV-2 were collected and evaluated. That cat recovered. As of March 31, 27 dogs and 15 cats from Hong Kong households in which one or more people were sick with COVID-19 had been held in quarantine. Only the 2 dogs and 1 cat mentioned above had positive results of testing for SARS-CoV-2 and none of the animals in quarantine had developed clinical signs of respiratory disease.To date, the CDC has not received any National Veterinary Service Laboratories (NVSL)-confirmed reports of pets or other animals becoming sick with COVID-19 in the United States, and there is no evidence to suggest that animals, including pets, that may be incidentally infected by humans are playing a role in the spread of COVID-19.

Animals are only being tested in rare circumstances and on a case-by-case basis after consultation with public health and animal health officials to determine if testing is needed. Routine testing of animals is not being recommended at this time

The AVMA, USDA, CDC, American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians (AAVLD), and National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians (NASPHV) do not recommend routine testing of animals for this virus. If a domestic animal becomes ill with respiratory or gastrointestinal signs, veterinarians are strongly encouraged to first test for common pathogens and conditions that are more likely to have caused such clinical signs.Discussion among key regulatory authorities and animal health experts (USDA, CDC, FDA, NASPHV, National Assembly of State Animal Health Officials [NASAHO], AVMA) indicates that testing may be justified for certain animals in the following situations:Because the situation is ever-evolving, animal and public health officials may decide to test certain animals meeting the above criteria. The decision to test will be made collaboratively between the attending veterinarian and local, state, and federal public health and animal and health officials, and your veterinarian will contact one of those officials for information about how to proceed. If samples are sent to state animal health, university, or private laboratories for initial testing, all samples should be collected by a licensed, and preferably USDA-accredited, veterinarian in duplicate because positive samples must be confirmed through additional testing by the USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL). Different states may also have different requirements for testing and collaborating with and reporting to public health and animal health officials.

If a domestic animal becomes ill with respiratory or gastrointestinal signs, veterinarians will first test for common pathogens and conditions that are more likely to have caused such clinical signs. If the results of tests for any of these common pathogens or conditions are positive, then the veterinarian will recommend treatment and care for that animal accordingly.If the results of tests for more common pathogens and conditions are negative, the veterinarian should contact a local, state, or federal public health or animal health official for information about how to proceed. Any decision to test an animal for SARS-CoV-2 will be made collaboratively with these officials and testing will generally only be done if there has been close contact between the animal and a COVID-19 positive person or if there is exposure of the animal to a high-risk environment where a human outbreak occurred, such as residence, facility (e.g., nursing home, prison), or cruise ship. Different states may also have different requirements for testing and collaborating with and reporting to public health and animal health officials.

Call your veterinarian with any questions about your animal’s health. You should tell them why you are concerned about your animal being ill (e.g., what clinical signs of illness you are seeing) and whether the animal has had close contact with someone who has been sick with COVID-19. Calling your veterinarian in advance will help your veterinarian determine whether your animal needs to be seen immediately and, if so, will support the veterinary clinic/hospital in preparing for the proper admittance of that animal, including the preparation of an isolation area as needed. Do not take the animal to a veterinary clinic/hospital until you have consulted with your veterinarian. A telemedicine consultation should be considered as an option as well.After an examination and evaluation of the animal to rule out more likely causes for the animal’s illness, veterinarians who believe an animal should be tested for SARS-CoV-2 will contact local, state, or federal public health or animal health officials, who will work with them to determine next steps.

Animals imported into the United States will need to meet CDC and USDA requirements for entering the United States. At this time, there is no evidence to suggest that animals, including pets, that may be incidentally infected by humans are playing a role in the spread of COVID-19. However, as should be done for any animal introduced into a new environment, recently imported animals should be observed daily for signs of illness. If an animal becomes ill, the animal should be examined by a veterinarian. Call your veterinarian before bringing the animal into the clinic/hospital and let them know that the animal was recently imported from another country.

If you are sick with COVID-19 or another communicable disease, you should stay at home, minimizing contact with other people, until you are well. Accordingly, if this is a non-urgent appointment for your pet or service animal consider rescheduling that appointment until your physician and/or your public health official believe you no longer present a risk of transmitting your infection to other people you may encounter during such a visit, including owners of pets or other animals and veterinary clinic staff. If you are sick with COVID-19, and you believe your pet or service animal is ill, you should seek assistance from your veterinarian to determine how to best ensure your pet or service animal can be appropriately cared for while minimizing risks of transmitting COVID-19 to other people.Don’t forget—if you have an established relationship with your veterinarian (i.e., they have seen your pet/service animal in the recent past), telemedicine can be an excellent way to connect you, your pet/service animal, and your veterinarian. It can be used to help determine the urgency with which an animal needs to be seen, whether the animal needs to be seen in-person, and can also be used to conduct rechecks of certain types of ongoing medical problems. If this is your first visit to the veterinarian, it may also be possible to conduct your appointment via telemedicine, depending on what services are needed and any discretion that is being applied by regulatory officials under the COVID-19 emergency for the practice of veterinary medicine in your state.Be sure to contact your veterinarian before heading to the veterinary clinic/hospital to see what they recommend for your situation.

If you are sick with COVID-19 you need to be careful to avoid transmitting it to other people. Applying some common-sense measures can help prevent that from happening. Stay at home except to get medical care and call ahead before visiting your doctor. Minimize your contact with other people, including separating yourself from other members of your household who are not ill; use a different bathroom, if available; and wear a cloth face mask when you are around other people or pets and before you enter a healthcare provider’s office. Wash your hands often, especially before touching your face, and use hand sanitizer. Use a tissue if you need to cough or sneeze and dispose of that tissue in the trash. When coughing or sneezing, do so into your elbow or sleeve. The AVMA recommends you take the same common-sense approach when interacting with your pets or other animals in your home, including service animals. You should tell your physician and public health official that you have a pet or other animal in your home. As a precaution, it is recommended that people sick with COVID-19 limit contact with animals until more information is known about the virus. So, if you are ill with COVID-19, have another member of your household take care of walking, feeding, and playing with your pet. If you have a service animal or you must care for your pet, then wear a cloth face covering; don’t share food, kiss, or hug them; and wash your hands before and after any contact with your pet or service animal. You should not share dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels, or bedding with other people or pets in your home. Cats belonging to owners infected with COVID-19 should also be kept indoors as much as possible. While we are recommending these as good practices, there is no evidence to suggest that animals, including pets, that may be incidentally infected by humans are playing a role in the spread of COVID-19.

You should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would restrict contact with other people. Although there have not been reports of pets becoming sick with COVID-19 in the United States, it is still recommended that people sick with COVID-19 limit contact with animals until more information is known about the virus.

Do not take the animal to a veterinary clinic/hospital until you have consulted with your veterinarian, especially if you are personally ill with COVID-19. And, of course, a telemedicine consultation should be considered as an option as well.If your pet gets sick, it is unlikely that it is because it has COVID-19; there is most likely a different cause for its illness. There is also no evidence to suggest that animals, including pets, that may be incidentally infected by humans are playing a role in the spread of COVID-19.

If you are not ill with COVID-19 or another communicable disease (e.g., cold, flu) and your pet is not ill, call your veterinarian to discuss whether and when an in-person visit is best conducted. Given current efforts to reduce the potential for human exposure to COVID-19, including recommendations for social distancing, your veterinarian may recommend postponing non-urgent visits or procedures. If you would prefer to remain in your home and you have an established relationship with the veterinarian (i.e., they have seen your pet/service animal in the recent past), telemedicine might be an excellent way to conduct your visit, depending on what services are required.

Identify another person in your household who is willing and able to care for your pet in your home should you contract COVID-19. Make sure you have an emergency kit prepared, with at least two weeks’ worth of your pet’s food and any needed medications. Usually we think about emergency kits like this in terms of what might be needed for an evacuation in the case of a disaster, but it’s also good to have one prepared in the case of quarantine or self-isolation when you cannot leave your home.

To observe social distancing, keep space of at least 6 feet between yourself and others who do not live in your home, do not gather in groups, and stay out of crowded areas. Dogs should be walked in the neighborhood in a way that allows for social distancing and keeps them safe. Avoid dog parks (many are currently closed) and other public places where groups of people and dogs may gather. To help maintain social distancing, do not let other people pet your dog when you are out for a walk.

COVID-19 appears to be primarily transmitted by contact with an infected person’s bodily secretions, such as saliva or mucus droplets in a cough or sneeze. It appears that COVID-19 can also be transmitted by touching a contaminated surface or object (i.e., a fomite) and then touching the mouth, nose, or possibly eyes, but this seems to be a secondary route. Smooth (non-porous) surfaces (e.g., countertops, doorknobs) transmit viruses better than porous materials (e.g., paper money, pet fur). Because your pet’s hair is porous, and fibrous, it is unlikely that you would contract COVID-19 by petting or playing with your pet. And, while we know that certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, we have no examples of where viruses have been transmitted by contact with pet hair or skin, including SARS-CoV-2. However, because pets can spread other diseases to people and people can also spread diseases to animals, it’s always a good idea to wash your hands before and after interacting with pets. There is no evidence to suggest that animals, including pets, that may be incidentally infected by humans are playing a role in the spread of COVID-19. Human outbreaks are driven by person-to-person transmission.While risk of transfer of SARS-CoV-2 from collars, leashes, and carriers also appears to be limited, it’s always a good idea to keep pet collars, leashes, and carriers clean and, fortunately, the SARS-CoV-2 virus is susceptible to routine cleaning. The Environmental Protection Agency has published a list of wipes, ready-to-use, and dilutable products for use against SARS-CoV-2.

legal gaming revenue (net of payouts but not other expenses) comprised less than 50 percent of the business’s total revenue in 2019.
 Businesses that received illegal gaming revenue are categorically ineligible. The Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary, believes this test appropriately balances the longstanding policy reasons for limiting lending to businesses primarily and substantially engaged in gaming activity with the policy aim of making the PPP Loan available to a broad segment of U.S. businesses and their employees."

"The amount of loan forgiveness can be up to the full principal amount of the loan plus accrued interest. The actual amount of loan forgiveness will depend, in part, on the total amount spent over the covered period on: 
payroll costs including salary, wages, and tips, up to $100,000 of annualized pay per employee (for eight weeks, a maximum of $15,385 per individual), as well as covered benefits for employees (but not owners), including health care expenses, retirement contributions, and state taxes imposed on employee payroll paid by the employer (such as unemployment insurance premiums);
	 
owner compensation replacement, calculated based on 2019 net profit as described in Paragraph 1.b. above, with forgiveness of such amounts limited to eight weeks’ worth (8/52) of 2019 net profit, but excluding any qualified sick leave equivalent amount for which a credit is claimed under section 7002 of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) (Public Law 116-127) or qualified family leave equivalent amount for which a credit is claimed under section 7004 of FFCRA;
	 
payments of interest on mortgage obligations on real or personal property incurred before February 15, 2020, to the extent they are deductible on Form 1040 Schedule C (business mortgage payments);
	 
rent payments on lease agreements in force before February 15, 2020, to the extent they are deductible on Form 1040 Schedule C (business rent payments); and
	 
utility payments under service agreements dated before February 15, 2020 to the extent they are deductible on Form 1040 Schedule C (business utility payments).
 The Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary, has determined that it is appropriate to limit the forgiveness of owner compensation replacement for individuals with self-employment income who file a Schedule C to eight weeks’ worth (8/52) of 2019 net profit. This is most consistent with the structure of the Act and its overarching focus on keeping workers paid and will prevent windfalls that Congress did not intend. Congress determined that the maximum loan amount is based on 2.5 months of the borrower’s payroll during the one-year period preceding the loan. Congress also determined that the maximum amount of loan forgiveness is based on the borrower’s eligible payments—i.e., the sum of payroll costs and certain overhead expenses— over the eight-week period following the date of loan disbursement. For individuals with self-employment income who file a Schedule C, the Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary, has determined that it is appropriate to limit loan forgiveness to a proportionate eight-week share of 2019 net profit, as reflected in the individual’s 2019 Form 1040 Schedule C. This is because many self-employed individuals have few of the overhead expenses that qualify for forgiveness under the Act. For example, many such individuals operate out of either their homes, vehicles, or sheds and thus do not incur qualifying mortgage interest, rent, or utility payments. As a result, most of their receipts will constitute net income. Allowing such a self-employed individual to treat the full amount of a PPP loan as net income would result in a windfall. The entire amount of the PPP loan (a maximum of 2.5 times monthly payroll costs) would be forgiven even though Congress designed this program to limit forgiveness to certain eligible expenses incurred in an eight-week covered period. Limiting forgiveness to eight weeks of net profit from the owner’s 2019 Form 1040 Schedule C is consistent with the structure of the Act, which provides for loan forgiveness based on eight weeks of expenditures. This limitation will also help to ensure that the finite appropriations are directed toward payroll protection, consistent with the Act’s central objective. Finally, 75 percent of the amount forgiven must be attributable to payroll costs for the reasons specified in the First PPP Interim Final Rule."

Yes.  At least 75 percent of the PPP loan proceeds shall be used for payroll costs.  For purposes of determining the percentage of use of proceeds for payroll costs (but not for forgiveness purposes), the amount of any refinanced EIDL will be included.  The rationale for this 75 percent floor is contained in the First PPP Interim Final Rule.

"The proceeds of a PPP loan are to be used for the following. 
Owner compensation replacement, calculated based on 2019 net profit as described in Paragraph 1.b. above
Employee payroll costs (as defined in the First PPP Interim Final Rule) for employees whose principal place of residence is in the United States, if you have employees.
Mortgage interest payments (but not mortgage prepayments or principal payments) on any business mortgage obligation on real or personal property (e.g., the interest on your mortgage for the warehouse you purchased to store business equipment or the interest on an auto loan for a vehicle you use to perform your business), business rent payments (e.g., the warehouse where you store business equipment or the vehicle you use to perform your business), and business utility payments (e.g., the cost of electricity in the warehouse you rent or gas you use driving your business vehicle). You must have claimed or be entitled to claim a deduction for such expenses on your 2019 Form 1040 Schedule C for them to be a permissible use during the eight-week period following the first disbursement of the loan (the “covered period”). For example, if you did not claim or are not entitled to claim utilities expenses on your 2019 Form 1040 Schedule C, you cannot use the proceeds for utilities during the covered period.
Interest payments on any other debt obligations that were incurred before February 15, 2020 (such amounts are not eligible for PPP loan forgiveness).
Refinancing an SBA EIDL loan made between January 31, 2020 and April 3, 2020 (maturity will be reset to PPP’s maturity of two years). If you received an SBA EIDL loan from January 31, 2020 through April 3, 2020, you can apply for a PPP loan. If your EIDL loan was not used for payroll costs, it does not affect your eligibility for a PPP loan. If your EIDL loan was used for payroll costs, your PPP loan must be used to refinance your EIDL loan. Proceeds from any advance up to $10,000 on the EIDL loan will be deducted from the loan forgiveness amount on the PPP loan.
 The Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary, determined that it is appropriate to limit self-employed individuals’ (who file a Form 1040 Schedule C) use of loan proceeds to those types of allowable uses for which the borrower made expenditures in 2019. The Administrator has determined that this limitation on self-employed individuals who file a Form 1040 Schedule C is consistent with the borrower certification required by the Act; specifically, that the PPP loan is necessary “to support the ongoing operations” of the borrower. The Administrator and the Secretary thus believe that this limitation is consistent with the structure of the Act to maintain existing operations and payroll and not for business expansion. This limitation on the use of PPP loan proceeds will also help to ensure that the finite appropriations available for these loans are directed toward maintaining existing operations and payroll, as each loan that is made depletes the appropriation. Finally, although the Act makes businesses in operation on February 15, 2020 eligible for PPP loans, the Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary, has determined that self-employed individuals will need to rely on their 2019 Form 1040 Schedule C, which provides verifiable documentation on expenses between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2019. For individuals with income from self-employment from 2019 for which they have filed or will file a 2019 Form 1040 Schedule C, expenses incurred between January 1, 2020 and February 14, 2020 may not be considered because of the lack of verifiable documentation on expenses in this period. SBA will issue additional guidance for those individuals with self-employment income who: (i) were not in operation in 2019 but who were in operation on February 15, 2020, and (ii) will file a Form 1040 Schedule C for 2020."

How you calculate your maximum loan amount depends upon whether or not you employ other individuals. If you have no employees, the following methodology should be used to calculate your maximum loan amount: Step 1: Find your 2019 IRS Form 1040 Schedule C line 31 net profit amount (if you have not yet filed a 2019 return, fill it out and compute the value). If this amount is over $100,000, reduce it to $100,000. If this amount is zero or less, you are not eligible for a PPP loan. Step 2: Calculate the average monthly net profit amount (divide the amount from Step 1 by 12). Step 3: Multiply the average monthly net profit amount from Step 2 by 2.5. Step 4: Add the outstanding amount of any Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) made between January 31, 2020 and April 3, 2020 that you seek to refinance, less the amount of any advance under an EIDL COVID-19 loan (because it does not have to be repaid). Regardless of whether you have filed a 2019 tax return with the IRS, you must provide the 2019 Form 1040 Schedule C with your PPP loan application to substantiate the applied-for PPP loan amount and a 2019 IRS Form 1099-MISC detailing nonemployee compensation received (box 7), invoice, bank statement, or book of record that 7 establishes you are self-employed. You must provide a 2020 invoice, bank statement, or book of record to establish you were in operation on or around February 15, 2020.

Proceeds from any advance up to $10,000 on the EIDL loan will be deducted from the loan forgiveness amount on the PPP loan.”  This guidance does not address what happens if you applied for an EIDL before April 3, 2020 but received one after that date.

The Emergency Economic Injury Grants. These grants provide an emergency advance of up to $10,000 to small businesses and private non-profits harmed by COVID-19 within three days of applying for an SBA Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL). To access the advance, you first apply for an EIDL and then request the advance. This Advance may be available even if your EIDL application was declined or is still pending and will be forgiven. The advance may be used to keep employees on payroll, to pay for sick leave, meet increased production costs due to supply chain disruptions, or pay business obligations, including debts, rent and mortgage payments. If an EIDL recipient later refinances into a PPP loan, any advances would be offset against any payroll related loan forgiveness.

Will unemployed be required to again begin looking for work?	After re-opening, the same unemployment insurance programs will remain available.  As is the case currently, individuals unemployed due to the pandemic will potentially remain eligible for unemployment insurance benefits.  The primary impact of reopening will be that if suitable work is available because an individual’s employer has reopened, but the individual chooses to not return to employment, they may be found ineligible for benefits.  Eligibility for future benefit payments is done on a case-by-case basis and could vary by situation.  Reopening, or the expiration of existing Executive Orders relating specifically to business operations, will not affect the Governor’s Executive Orders relating to items such as the temporary suspension of the unemployment insurance work search requirement.  These Orders will remain in force until the Governor specifically rescinds them.  There is not a sunset or expiration date on these particular orders.

Are there any protections for them if they don’t feel safe returning to work?	Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA), employees may refuse work if they “reasonably believe they are in imminent danger.” That fear typically includes the threat of death or serious physical harm. Generalized fear about the virus, that’s not based on fact, would not likely be sufficient to refuse to work. However, if the workplace currently has a number of confirmed cases of COVID-19, their fears may be justified. For workers who are at higher risk for negative outcomes if they contract COVID-19, such as those with underlying medical conditions or workers who are immunocompromised, even generalized fears may be legitimate. Businesses should work with these staff members to alter the work environment as much as possible to mitigate risk, if they can.

Yes. An employer may encourage or require employees to telework as an infection-control or prevention strategy, including based on timely information from public health authorities about pandemics, public health emergencies, or other similar conditions. But employers must not single out employees either to telework or to continue reporting to the workplace on a basis prohibited by any of the Equal Employment Opportunity laws (e.g., race, gender, country of origin).

If you are an employee described above and can show that you have contracted COVID-19 through a work-related exposure, you may file a workers’ compensation claim for benefits including wage-loss, medical, and death benefits. If you are subject to quarantine per an order of a health care provider or public health officer, you may receive medical and wage-loss benefits for the quarantine period. Eligibility for wage loss benefits only applies if you are not eligible for wage-loss benefits from another source. For example, as of April 1, 2020, federal law mandates most employers provide paid leave for employees in quarantine (https://ndresponse.gov/covid-19-resources/covid-19-faqs).  As a result, this wage-loss benefit provides a safety net for those not already covered by another resource.  For quarantines prior to April 1, 2020, WSI will pay wage-loss benefits if you must use accrued PTO or sick leave for the quarantine period. However, if an employer grants additional leave or continues to pay wages for the quarantine period, WSI will not pay benefits.

Person-to-person spread
	
The virus is thought to spread mainly from person to person.


Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about six feet).
	
Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.


Spread from contact with infected surfaces or objects
	
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.


Can someone spread the virus without being sick?
	
People are thought to be most contagious when they are most symptomatic (the sickest).
Some spread might be possible before people show symptoms. There have been reports of this occurring with this new coronavirus, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.

Being in an indoor environment (e.g., store, workplace, restaurant) with someone who has COVID-19 is not necessarily considered having close contact. A close contact is defined as a person who spends a prolonged period of time within 6 feet (2 meters) of a person that has been diagnosed with COVID-19. Close contact can occur while caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a health care waiting area or room with someone that has been diagnosed with COVID-19.  The North Dakota Department of Health will be conducting interviews with all persons diagnosed with COVID-19 to determine who their close contacts are. People who are identified as close contacts will be notified by the North Dakota Department of Health and will receive instruction on quarantine and monitoring.  If you have not been contacted by the North Dakota Department of Health after you have been in the same location with a person diagnosed with COVID-19, you are not considered a close contact but should continue to follow social distancing guidance, good handwashing hygiene and staying home if you become sick. Any person with a fever and/or respiratory symptoms who was not tested, should stay home until at least 3 days (72 hours) have passed since recovery (fever-free without the use of fever-reducing medications) and improvement in respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath); and at least 10 days have passed since symptoms first appeared.

Employees may be eligible for both types of leave, but only for a total of twelve weeks of paid leave. They may take both paid sick leave and expanded family and medical leave to care for a child whose school or place of care is closed, or child care provider is unavailable, due to COVID-19 related reasons. The Emergency Paid Sick Leave Act provides for an initial two weeks of paid leave. This period thus covers the first ten workdays of expanded family and medical leave, which are otherwise unpaid under the Emergency and Family Medical Leave Expansion Act unless the employee elects to use existing vacation, personal, or medical or sick leave under the company’s policy. After the first ten workdays have elapsed, the employee will receive 2/3 of their regular rate of pay for the hours s/he would have been scheduled to work in the subsequent ten weeks under the Emergency and Family Medical Leave Expansion Act. Additionally, if an employee takes expanded family and medical leave, you must require them to provide you with documentation that supports the reason for taking this leave. This may include a notice that has been posted on a school, daycare, or government website, published in a newspaper, or an email notification sent by the school district, child care provider, etc. You should retain these documents for your records if you plan to claim a tax credit under FFCRA.

"There are several reasons your claim could be denied, but it is important to remember that with the new federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) and Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC), almost all individuals will be eligible for benefits if they are unemployed due to the pandemic.  The federal government considers PUA and PEUC to be programs of last resort.  This means that they are only available to individuals who are not eligible for regular state unemployment insurance, or those who have been denied regular state unemployment insurance. Following are some details explaining why you may have been denied regular UI benefits and what you should do next: 
Your earnings do not qualify you for regular unemployment insurance benefits
	
If you receive a Monetary Determination noting that you are not eligible for benefits, you should file a claim using the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance link.


You filed a claim less than a year ago but you have used up all of your benefits (exhausted your claim)
	
If you have received all of the benefits available to you on a claim you filed within the last year, you should file a claim using the Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation link.


You are unemployed for a reason other than the pandemic
	
If you are unemployed for a reason not related to the pandemic, you will need to follow normal procedures in place for state unemployment insurance benefits (click “File a Regular UI Claim”).  The most common reasons for these types of denials will be if you quit a job or were terminated by your employer.  You will be notified of your eligibility with a Non-Monetary Determination.  This determination will provide you with information and actions you should take if you do not agree with the determination.

Due to the indefinite closure of North Dakota schools, NDDPI has made the difficult decision to cancel all ACT Makeup Testing dates for this spring. ACT has offered North Dakota and its juniors who were not able to test on the initial test date of March 3, 2020, the opportunity to take the ACT with Writing on either the June 2020 or July 2020 national test date, at no cost to them. NDDPI is currently working with ACT to obtain vouchers. This process will take several weeks. NDDPI will share the vouchers with schools when available.  Schools will be responsible to deliver the vouchers to students. Students will need to go to ACT’s Website to register for the national June 13, 2020 or July 18, 2020 test date, using the state provided voucher, by the registration deadline. On this registration site, students will be able to choose an available test center nearest to them. Schools must email the Office of Assessment by Wednesday, April 15, 2020, to request vouchers for their juniors who were not able to test on the initial state ACT test date. In the email, please provide the number of juniors who need vouchers for either the June 13, 2020 or July 18, 2020 national test dates. Only one voucher will be allowed per student, but vouchers will work for either test date. For more information please visit https://www.nd.gov/dpi/school-closure-faq

A short-term medical plan is a temporary health insurance policy typically offering “bare-bones” coverage designed for use during unexpected coverage gaps. An individual can only hold a short-term medical plan for a short period of time, less than one year. These plans are nonrenewable. Furthermore, they do not meet the coverage requirements of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), meaning an individual may have to pay a monetary penalty for not carrying acceptable health insurance coverage. With the regulations established by the ACA, short-term medical, limited benefit and discount medical plans have become increasingly popular. However, consumers must be aware of what they are purchasing before replacing their comprehensive major medical coverage with one of these options. Remember, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Short-term Medical, Limited Benefit and Discount Medical Plans Guide

There are discussions underway at both the state and federal level about finding a way to make this pandemic a triggering event. While that would potentially bring coverage, it would have a massive effect on the insurance industry. Insurance is a product that is risk rated and sold based on those risks that are covered in the policy. This type of event was excluded from many policies, and to retroactively enact coverage would put the entire insurance industry at risk of insolvency. This move could also lead to dramatic rate increases, which could also make insurance unaffordable to businesses as we look to recover from this pandemic.  Additionally, the government retroactively amending contracts (insurance agreements) would also face significant constitutional issues and would ultimately be challenged in court.  The best option at this point may be to explore what resources are available in North Dakota and through the federal government.

Losses are broken down under three main coverages:  
Basic – named perils needs to be listed in the policy. 
Broad – named perils needs to be listed in the policy. 
 Example of a named peril: 
Infectious Diseases – this includes loss caused by the complete interruption of your operations by an infectious disease acquired by your employees or staff.  
Special – covers any loss not excluded in the policy, must be direct physical loss. 
 Example of an exclusion: 
Virus or Bacteria – any virus, bacterium or other microorganism that induces or is capable of inducing physical distress, illness or disease. 
 
Common Policy Verbiage: When Special is shown in the Declarations, Covered Causes of Loss means direct physical loss unless the loss is excluded or limited in this policy."

If you have a health benefit plan regulated by the State of North Dakota, you should not have to pay for the test. A health benefit plan is generally defined as an individual (including family), small group, large group, or short-term limited duration plan. The Department recommends that you contact your health benefit plan at the number listed on your identification card to see if your specific plan is regulated by North Dakota and is not self-funded.   Pursuant to Bulletin 2020-1 issued by Insurance Commissioner Jon Godfread, health carriers have been asked to waive any cost-sharing, including co-pays, deductibles, and coinsurance for Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended laboratory testing of COVID-19.  In addition, health carriers have also been asked to waive cost-sharing for an in-network provider office visit, urgent care center visit, or an emergency room visit when testing for COVID-19. This includes short-term limited duration policies but does not include health sharing ministries as those plans are generally not subject to any regulation.

"Unfortunately, it’s unlikely that you will find coverage through your business disruption coverage. Generally, the triggering event for coverage would include physical damage; a pandemic is not considered physical damage. Also, under business disruption coverage there can be Civil Authority coverage, this too generally is triggered by physical damage.  Standard policies also usually contain an exclusion for viral pandemics or pandemics. These exclusions arose in or around 2003, during the SARs outbreak and are traditionally maintained in the standard language of commercial insurance. Keep in mind that policies can differ greatly, so it’s always important to talk with your licensed insurance agent to clarify exactly what is or is not included in your coverage. 
Business interruption insurance coverage protects against losses sustained due to periods of suspended operations; it pays loss of revenue that would have been earned if there was no business interruption. It typically provides coverage only if a physical loss to property occurs and may have specific exclusions for viral infections such as COVID-19.
Contingent business interruption insurance policies protect against losses from supply chain disruptions but may require the occurrence of property damage to trigger coverage. 
Event cancellation insurance provides coverage for expenses arising from delays, rescheduling or cancellations due to unforeseen covered events. Typically, contingent business interruption and event cancellation insurance policies exclude coverage for communicable diseases, such as COVID-19."

Is hand sanitizer effective against COVID-19?	A. The best way to prevent the spread of infections and decrease the risk of getting sick is by washing your hands with plain soap and water, advises the CDC. Washing hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds is essential, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after coughing, sneezing, or blowing one’s nose. If soap and water are not available, CDC recommends consumers use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.

Where can I buy hand sanitizer? If I can’t find it in the store, can I make my own?	"A. Many retail stores and pharmacies sell hand sanitizers. However, we understand that many stores have run out of hand sanitizers and they may be difficult to find. To help increase the availability of hand sanitizers, the FDA has issued guidance for the temporary preparation of alcohol-based hand sanitizers by some companies and pharmacies during the public health emergency posed by COVID-19. 
The FDA does not recommend that consumers make their own hand sanitizer. If made incorrectly, hand sanitizer can be ineffective, and there have been reports of skin burns from homemade hand sanitizer. The agency lacks verifiable information on the methods being used to prepare hand sanitizer at home and whether they are safe for use on human skin.

Convalescent plasma is the liquid part of blood that is collected from patients who have recovered from the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 patients develop antibodies in the blood against the virus. Antibodies are proteins  that might help fight the infection. Convalescent plasma is being investigated for the treatment of COVID-19 because there is no approved treatment for this disease and there is some information that suggests it might help some patients recover from COVID-19. Further investigation is still necessary to determine if convalescent plasma might shorten the duration of illness, reduce morbidity, or prevent death associated with COVID-19.

Recent research shows that ferrets, cats, and golden Syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with the virus and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings. Pigs, chickens, and ducks did not become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies. Data from one study suggest that dogs are not as likely to become infected with the virus as cats and ferrets. These findings were based upon a small number of animals and do not indicate whether animals can spread infection to people."

"The tiger infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 is the first case of its kind. We are still learning about this virus and how it spreads, but it appears it can spread from humans to animals in some situations. FDA is aware of a very small number of pets outside the United States, including cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 after close contact with people with COVID-19.
At this time, there is no evidence that pets, including cats and dogs, can spread COVID-19 to people. The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person, typically through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking.
People sick with COVID-19 should isolate themselves from other people and animals, including pets, during their illness until we know more about how this virus affects animals. If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear a cloth face covering and wash your hands before and after you interact with pets."

"The FDA, USDA and CDC recommend that any testing of animals should be conducted using kits not required when testing people. USDA’s National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) and the laboratories of the National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN) use tests developed for animal testing that are not used for testing in people. This avoids placing additional stresses on human testing resources while also recognizing the potential importance of animal testing to supporting public health. 
Although animal and human tests are generally similar, this type of testing has to be adjusted in each species and for each sample type (blood, feces, nasal swab). Human and animal tests are not intended to be interchangeable. Some testing performed on animals is based on the published tests used in people, but animal testing is not likely to reduce the availability of tests for people if labs follow recommendations from FDA, USDA, and CDC that animal testing be conducted using tests developed for animals."

"Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets.
However, because animals can sometimes carry other germs that can make people sick, it’s always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, including washing hands before and after interacting with them and especially after cleaning up their waste."

"Yes. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some coronaviruses like COVID-19 cause cold-like illnesses in people, while others cause illness in certain types of animals, such as cattle, camels, and bats. Some coronaviruses, such as canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals and do not infect humans. For example, bovine coronavirus causes diarrhea in young calves, and pregnant cows are routinely vaccinated to help prevent infection in calves. This vaccine is only licensed for use in cattle for bovine coronavirus and is not licensed to prevent COVID-19 in cattle or other species, including humans.
Dogs can get a respiratory coronavirus, which is part of the complex of viruses and bacteria associated with canine infectious respiratory disease, commonly known as “kennel cough.” While this virus is highly contagious among both domestic and wild dogs, it is not transmitted to other animal species or humans.
Most strains of feline enteric coronavirus, a gastrointestinal form, are fought off by a cat’s immune system without causing disease. However, in a small proportion of these cats, the virus can cause feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a disease that is almost always fatal.
Other species, like horses, turkeys, chickens, and swine, can contract their own species-specific strains of coronavirus but, like the other strains mentioned above, they are not known to be transmissible to humans. More information is available in the American Veterinary Medical Association’s fact sheet about coronaviruses in domestic species."

"In certain types of emergencies, the FDA can issue an emergency use authorization, or EUA, to provide more timely access to critical medical products that may help during the emergency when there are no adequate, approved, and available alternative options. The EUA process is different than full FDA approval, clearance, or licensing because the EUA standard requires significantly less data than otherwise would be required for approval, clearance, or licensing by the FDA. This enables the FDA to authorize the emergency use of medical products that meet the criteria for issuance within weeks rather than months to years. Under the EUA authority, the FDA evaluates requests for authorization very quickly using the evidence that is available, carefully balancing the risks and benefits of the product as we know them, in addition to evaluating other criteria. EUAs are in effect until the emergency declaration ends but can be revised or revoked as we evaluate the needs during the emergency, or as products meet the criteria to become approved, cleared, or licensed by the FDA. The What is an EUA? video provides a short summary of this information. 
On February 4, 2020, the HHS Secretary determined that there is a public health emergency involving COVID-19, and subsequently issued declarations justifying the use of EUAs for medical products to prevent, treat and diagnose COVID-19. To date, over 100 EUAs have been issued to allow emergency access to tests, medical devices, personal protective equipment and therapeutics. See the EUAs that have been issued for COVID-19."

Are there data showing remdesivir might benefit patients with COVID-19?	"A. In vitro (laboratory) testing of remdesivir demonstrated it is active against SARS-CoV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19). Preliminary results from a Phase 3 placebo-controlled clinical trial of remdesivir by the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases suggests that patients taking remdesivir experienced faster time to recovery as compared to patients taking a placebo. This trial included a sizeable proportion of patients who were receiving mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) at baseline.  Based on these findings, the Fact Sheet for Health Care Providers details a 10-day treatment course for patients receiving mechanical ventilation or ECMO. 
Preliminary results from a different Phase 3 trial evaluating 5-day and 10-day dosing durations of remdesivir in hospitalized patients with severe coronavirus disease reported that patients receiving a 5-day treatment course achieved similar improvement as those taking a 10-day treatment course; however, importantly, very few patients in this trial were receiving mechanical ventilation or ECMO at baseline. Therefore, based on these findings, the Fact Sheet for Health Care Providers details a 5-day treatment course for patients who are not receiving mechanical ventilation or ECMO. Patients who receive a 5-day treatment course but do not demonstrate clinical improvement are eligible to continue to receive remdesivir for an additional 5 days.
The safety and efficacy of remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 are being evaluated in multiple ongoing clinical trials.
Because remdesivir may possibly help very sick patients, the FDA is allowing this drug to be provided to hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) issued May 1, 2020. Under the EUA, health care providers and patients are provided with information about the risks of remdesivir. However, final data from clinical trials included in an FDA application are necessary for us to determine whether the drug is safe and effective in treating COVID-19."

Should I take chloroquine phosphate used to treat disease in aquarium fish to prevent or treat COVID-19?	A. No. Products marketed for veterinary use, “for research only,” or otherwise not for human consumption have not been evaluated for safety or effectiveness and should never be used by humans. The FDA is aware that chloroquine phosphate is marketed to treat disease in aquarium fish, but these products have not been evaluated by the FDA to determine if they are safe, effective, properly manufactured, and adequately labeled. The agency continues to work with online marketplaces to remove these items, and many have been removed based on these efforts. Patients should not take any form of chloroquine unless it has been prescribed by a licensed health care provider. Chloroquine products also should not be given to pets or livestock unless prescribed by a veterinarian.

"We have established a cross-agency task force dedicated to closely monitoring for fraudulent COVID-19 products. In response to internet scammers, the FDA has taken – and continues to take – actions to stop those selling unapproved products that fraudulently claim to prevent, treat, diagnose or cure COVID-19. The FDA and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issue warning letters to companies and individuals that are unlawfully selling unapproved products with fraudulent COVID-19 claims. As of June 2020, the FDA has issued over 60 warning letters to sellers making bogus COVID-19 claims about their products. The FDA also has taken enforcement action against certain sellers that continued to illegally market products as treatments for COVID-19. 
Additionally, the FDA also has reached out to major retailers to ask for their help in monitoring online marketplaces for fraudulent COVID-19 products. The task force has already worked with marketplaces and platforms, resulting in the removal of dozens of these types of online product listings. You can report websites selling fraudulent medical products to the FDA through our website, by phone at 1-800-332-1088, or email to FDA-COVID-19-Fraudulent-Products@fda.hhs.gov.

"Certain veterinary diagnostic laboratories have developed diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, for use in pets if needed. 
Diagnostic tests for animals are regulated differently than those for humans. The FDA does not require approval or clearance of a 510(k), PMA, or any other pre-market submission for devices, including diagnostic tests, intended for animal use. The FDA does, however, have post-market regulatory oversight over devices intended for animal use and can take appropriate regulatory action if an animal device is misbranded or adulterated.
Certain private, state, and university veterinary diagnostic laboratories have developed diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, for use in dogs and cats. The FDA is also aware of at least two veterinary tests for COVID-19 in pets developed by commercial laboratories initially for internal surveillance, but the agency has not evaluated the validity of these tests. The tests are not currently available for routine testing. The decision to test pets should be made collaboratively between local, state, or federal public and animal health officials."

How are people tested for COVID-19?	A. In general, for diagnostic tests, samples are collected from a person’s nose and/or throat using swabs or other collection devices by a healthcare provider in a health care setting. A health care professional swabbing the back of the nasal cavity through the nostril is the preferred way to collect a sample to test for COVID-19. Alternatively, a health care professional may swab the back of your throat or the inside of the front of the nose. Certain tests may also allow collection of alternative sample types. Additionally, the FDA has authorized some tests for use with home sample collection kits that are prescribed by a doctor and allow the patient to collect the sample at home and send it directly to the lab for analysis.

"No, at this time, the FDA has not authorized any COVID-19 test to be completely used and processed at home. However, the FDA has issued emergency use authorizations (EUAs)  for certain COVID-19 molecular diagnostic tests to be used with samples collected by a person using a home collection kit that is sent to a laboratory for processing and test reporting. In general, a healthcare provider determines whether a person can use a home collection kit as explained in each test’s EUA.
The FDA sees the public health value in expanding the availability of COVID-19 testing through safe and accurate tests that may include home collection options, and we are actively working with test developers to expand the use of such options."

"There are two different types of tests – diagnostic tests and antibody tests.
A diagnostic test can show if you have an active coronavirus infection and should take steps to quarantine or isolate yourself from others. Currently there are two types of diagnostic tests – molecular (RT-PCR) tests that detect the virus’s genetic material, and antigen tests that detect specific proteins on the surface of the virus. Samples are typically collected with a nasal or throat swab, or saliva collected by spitting into a tube.
An antibody test looks for antibodies that are made by the immune system in response to a threat, such as a specific virus. Antibodies can help fight infections. Antibodies can take several days or weeks to develop after you have an infection and may stay in your blood for several weeks after recovery. Because of this, antibody tests should not be used to diagnose an active coronavirus infection. At this time, researchers do not know if the presence of antibodies means that you are immune to the coronavirus in the future. While there is a lot of uncertainty with this new virus, it is also possible that, over time, broad use of antibody tests and clinical follow-up will provide the medical community with more information on whether or not, and how long, a person who has recovered from the virus is at lower risk of infection if they are exposed to the virus again. Samples are typically blood from a finger stick or blood draw.

COVID-19 is primarily spread through respiratory droplets. That means to become infected, you generally must be within six feet of someone who is contagious and come into contact with these droplets. It may be possible to get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching your mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, Symptoms of COVID-19 appear within two to 14 days after exposure and include fever, cough, diarrhea and shortness of breath.

The CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public, especially in places where it’s hard to maintain at least 6 feet of distance between yourself and another person. Cloth face masks are being recommended because we now know individuals with COVID-19 could have mild or no symptoms, while still spreading the virus to others. Wearing a cloth mask does not replace the need for physical distancing. The cloth face coverings recommended by the CDC are not surgical masks or N-95 respirators, which should be reserved for healthcare workers and first responders.

"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it’s not yet known whether pregnant women are more susceptible to getting COVID-19 or are likely to have more severe symptoms, compared with individuals of a similar age and health status, who aren’t pregnant. However, it’s still important for pregnant women to protect themselves from illnesses. We recommend to: 
Wash your hands frequently. You’ve heard this advice over and over, but for good reason. Cleaning your hands can really stop the virus in its track.
Practice social distancing. Maintain a 6-foot distance from other people, and avoid groups of individuals larger than 10.
Get the flu shot. It won’t protect you against COVID-19, but it will lower your risk of catching influenza — another more common respiratory illness that can cause complications for expectant moms.
Go virtual. Whenever possible, consider virtual prenatal visits with your doctor instead of in-person appointments. Spending less time in the waiting room and doctor’s office might reduce the risk of catching the virus. However, some important prenatal care visits will still need to be in-person, such as ultrasounds, fetal testing and some blood work.
Call your doctor if you’re coughing. If you develop flu-like symptoms such as a cough, fever, runny nose or shortness of breath, contact your doctor via telephone or virtual visit. They’ll determine if you should be tested for the coronavirus and what your next steps should be."

Should I cancel my appointment?	The safety of our patients and caregivers remains our top priority. We want to assure patients that our Cleveland Clinic facilities are safe for them to receive care. We have taken steps to increase safety by limiting visitors, screening everyone for potential COVID-19 symptoms, providing essential Personal Protective Equipment for caregivers, practicing physical distancing, expanding testing capabilities and continuing to clean our facilities extensively. We are also requiring our caregivers to wear masks while at work, and strongly recommending patients and permitted visitors wear cloth masks at our facilities. If you are unsure about keeping your appointment, contact your physician’s office to see if other options are available. For patients who require a physical exam, in-person appointments will remain as scheduled. Our clinicians are meeting regularly to closely monitor this evolving situation. If you have a fever, cough, diarrhea or shortness of breath, or are otherwise concerned you have COVID-19, we ask you do not come to any Cleveland Clinic facility. Start with a virtual visit using Cleveland Clinic Express Care® Online, an eVisit questionnaire in MyChart or call your primary care physician. Patients will then be evaluated to determine if they require being seen in person or if they meet CDC guidelines for COVID-19 testing based on symptoms, travel and exposures. If a patient meets criteria for testing, their provider or primary care physician will advise them with next best steps.

The 14-day quarantine applies to those who are asymptomatic for the entire period.

Most resources and support services, such as WIC, home visiting and mental health services, continue to be available. These services may be offered through alternative methods, such as telephonic or virtual options; therefore, it is important to stay informed through local communication (e.g., contacting the service provider/agency, visiting their website, social media, local newspapers, and radio stations) and keeping your contact information up-to-date with all service providers

If you have COVID-19 or are suspected of having COVID-19, staying in a different room from your baby is the safest way to keep your newborn healthy. A healthy caregiver should take care of the baby and can feed expressed breast milk. If you and your family decide to keep your baby in the same room as you, keep a distance of at least 6 feet from your baby when possible. When closer than 6 feet, wear a mask and make sure your hands are clean. Be sure not to touch the front of the mask, and change out the mask when it is damp. You can stop isolating yourself from your baby once you are fever-free without use of fever medicines (acetaminophen or ibuprofen) for at least 72 hours; when your other symptoms of COVID-19 are improving; and when at least 7 days have passed since your symptoms started.

Good hygiene (handwashing) and social distancing are the most effective ways to keep your infant safe from communicable diseases such as COVID-19. All caregivers should be reminded to wash hands thoroughly before touching bottles and other feeding supplies, and before feeding or caring for an infant or child. Continuing to follow all public health recommendations, lining up a symptom-free support person to help drop off supplies, and connecting with friends and family virtually (phone, text, FaceTime, social media) will limit the exposure of the virus/disease to you and your family. While screen time is typically not recommended for infants, connecting to loved ones via video chatting such as FaceTime is considered safe in limited amounts. Ways of keeping your children safe:• Wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.• Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer when handwashing is unavailable.• Reduce close contact with others by practicing social distancing. Limit public exposure and avoid unnecessary public contact.• If going out with the child is essential:o Cover the infant carrier (NOT THE INFANT) with a light-weight blanket, which helps protect the baby, but still gives them the ability to breathe comfortably.o Make the trip and time of coverage as brief as possible.o Do not leave the blanket on the carrier in the car or at any time when the baby and carrier are not in direct view by an adult caregiver.o Children only over the age of 2 should wear a mask or cloth face covering.• Keep your children away from others who are sick and keep them home if they are sick.• Teach kids to cough and sneeze into a tissue or their arm or elbow, not their hands.• Clean commonly used surfaces regularly with disinfectant. Clean commonly touched surfaces (e.g., countertops, tables, doorknobs) regularly with disinfectant.• Wash stuffed animals or other plush toys in the warmest water possible, being sure to dry them completely.• Teach children to avoid touching face.• Follow local and state guidance on travel and stay-at-home restrictions.

Yes. Breast milk provides protection against many illnesses and is the best source of nutrition for most infants. Breastfed infants are generally less likely to have severe respiratory symptoms if they get sick. Breastfeeding is good for moms, releasing hormones during breastfeeding that promote wellness and can relieve stress and anxiety. Breast milk is readily available, and especially important during emergencies. In limited studies on women with COVID-19 and another coronavirus infection, the virus has not been detected in breastmilk. For moms who are infected with COVID-19, breastfeeding directly and pumping breast milk to be fed via bottle by an uninfected caregiver are both options for providing the best nutrition (breast milk) to babies. COVID-19 spreads between people who are in close contact, mainly through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. Therefore, if the person feeding the baby by breast or bottle is COVID+, he/she should wear a face mask or mouth/nose covering and wash their hands before each feeding, as well as during breast milk pumping and/or any bottle preparation, to reduce the risk of transmission. All bottle, breast pump parts and supplies should be cleaned thoroughly following CDC guidelines. For more information please review resources about COVID-19 and breastfeeding provided by the Kansas Breastfeeding Coalition. As always, it is important to talk with your doctor and a breastfeeding support professional to weigh the risks and benefits and help determine what is best in an individual situation.

There is not enough information, research, or literature to definitively answer the question as to whether COVID-19 can cause problems during pregnancy. We also do not know if a pregnant woman with COVID-19 can pass the virus to her baby during pregnancy or delivery. There have been a very small number of newborns who have tested positive after being born to a mother with COVID-19, but due to an extremely small number of cases, studies still have not determined when the newborn became infected with the virus. It is unclear if it occurred in the womb, during the birthing process, or immediately after birth. The virus has not been found in samples of amniotic fluid, umbilical cord blood or breastmilk. It is critical that appropriate precautions are taken after delivery to prevent the spread of the virus from the mother to the infant. At this time, experts say there is no need to change the timing or method (cesarean vs. vaginal) of delivery to decrease the risk of spread to the infant. Overall, babies seem to do fairly well, with mild symptoms and good outcomes, although a limited study has shown infants to have a higher rate of severe disease than older children. In the rare case of infant death, it has not been determined if it was due to the virus or other underlying (original, or already existing) conditions. Updated: April 30, 2020

There is very little information at this stage, so we do not currently know if pregnant women are at greater risk of getting COVID-19. We do know that pregnant women experience changes in their bodies that may increase their risk for contracting some infections. We also know that pregnant women have had a higher risk of developing severe illness with viruses from the same family as COVID-19 and other viral respiratory infections such as influenza. Therefore, it is important for pregnant women to take extra precautions to protect themselves from illness and talk with their doctor. Updated: April 3, 2020

The stores are all sold out. I want to wear one to protect myself when I go out in public.	Do not use surgical masks or N95 masks. These masks are considered specialized personal protective equipment (PPE) and should be reserved for first responders and health care workers to protect from serious injuries or illnesses while doing their jobs. If you have supplies of PPE, consider donating them. Homemade masks are NOT meant to replace proven public health strategies like staying home, social distancing and practicing good hygiene, which are all still the best ways to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. If used correctly, masks are simply another tool to help people who may have the virus -- but don’t know it -- from transmitting it to others. To use a homemade mask safely and effectively, remember this helpful acronym: M.A.S.K.M = Multi-layered, tightly-woven 100% cotton --180+ thread count. Don’t buy surgical or N95 masks.A = Avoid your face. Never touch the front of the mask. Always remove it from behind your head.S = Scrap it if it’s damaged, soiled or doesn’t fit. Make sure it’s breathable and fits snug. Don’t use while it’s damp, wet or dirty.K = Keep the mask and your hands clean. Wash your hands before and after use. Wash or dispose the mask after every use. Learn how to make a mask. Learn about children and masks.

They have already been fingerprinted by the school district; will they need to be re-printed?	New prints are required if staff previously working for school districts are transitioning to work in licensed child care facilities. The reason for this is that background check information cannot be shared between agencies or businesses (in this case, school and child care) and each may have specific prohibitions mandated by law. Keep in mind that individuals transferring from one licensed child care facility to another licensed facility would not need to be fingerprinted if they had previously passed a fingerprint-based background check.

Is KDHE processing background check requests? What if our local law enforcement agency has suspended non-criminal fingerprinting? Will there be a grace period?	Licensees must continue to submit the necessary request for background checks for individuals working, regularly volunteering, or residing in the facility. KDHE staff are working and affiliate names are being processed. Currently, all affiliate names are undergoing name-based records checks. This process is similar to the KDHE requirements prior to June of 2018. Name-based records checks include Kansas Bureau of Investigation (KBI) Kansas adult criminal and juvenile adjudications, Kansas sex offender registry, and the Kansas Department for Children and Families (DCF) child abuse and neglect registry.NOTE: For affiliates requiring comprehensive fingerprint-based checks, the automatic NORPLY email with the OCA numbers will continue to be sent. KDHE expects fingerprints to be completed within 90 days from the date the state of emergency is lifted (date not yet determined). However, for now licensees may disregard the “14-day requirement” that is stated in the OCA email. Please keep a record of the OCA number on file; it will be needed once fingerprinting resumes. Individuals who have lived outside of Kansas within the last five years will need to submit the necessary out-of-state request forms available on the KDHE Child Care Licensing Program website. During the COVID-19 State Disaster Emergency, individuals may begin working once the request for background checks has been submitted to KDHE. Updated: April 14, 2020

To support licensees facing economic or other obstacles, Governor Kelly issued Executive Order (EO) 20-19 on April 9, 2020. Renewal dates are extended under the provisions of the order. A license that was effective and in good standing as of March 12, 2020, and that has expired or will expire during the COVID-19 State Disaster Emergency shall remain valid until 90 days following termination of the emergency declaration (date not yet determined). Licensees experiencing hardship may delay submitting a renewal application for up to 90 days following the end of the Governor’s emergency declaration. For those that are able to submit a renewal application, thank you.
