# Scraped Data

For now we will dump scraped data here. The data should be stored as [jsonl](http://jsonlines.org/) - that is one json object per line. Use the following naming convention: `<Source>_<schema_version>.jsonl`. So `CDC_v0.1.jsonl` will refer to data scraped from the CDC website and stored under the v0.1 schema
