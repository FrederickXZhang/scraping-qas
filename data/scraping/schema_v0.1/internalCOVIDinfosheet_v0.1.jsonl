If the person is healthy, there is likely no need for them to wear a mask - as there is little evidence showing that these masks used by healthy people will prevent transmission to the public.  What masks can be useful in for the general public is reducing the amount of times a person touches their face, which means less opportunity for COVID19 to enter their body. This is because the mask is covering a significant amount of a person's face (namely the mouth and nose). This is the most effective practice when used in combination with frequent hand-washing with soap and water, or with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.  However, these is a shortage of available face masks for health workers - which is dangerous as they are on the frontlines of this pandemic.   [[Would you like more information?]] There are currently not enough face masks for health workers to use, which is dangerous as they are on the frontlines of this pandemic. This ranges from basic surgical masks to respirator masks. Health workers are also being asked to reuse them. This situation makes health workers vulnerable to becoming infected with COVID-19. If you have a surplus of face masks, it is currently recommended to donate that to your local healthcare facility.

Orient which side is the top side (which is where the metal strip is) 4. Ensure that the proper side of the mask is facing outwards (the colored side) 5. Place the mask to your face.

After use, take the mask off - remove the elastic loops from behind your ears, while keeping the mask away from your face and clothes. This is to avoid touching potentially contaminated surfaces of the mask 8. Discard the mask in a closed trash can immediately after use 9.

If you do need to travel, please consider the following:  1. Is COVID-19 spreading in the area where you're going? If it is, you may be more likely to get infected if you travel there than if you stay at home.  2. Will you or your travel companions be in close contact with others during your trip?  Your risk increases in crowded settings, especially closed-in setttings that do not have good circulation. This includes conferences, concerts, etc.  3. Are you or your travel companion more likely to get severe illness if you get COVID-19?  People at higher risk for severe disease are older adults and people of any age with serious chronic medical conditions (e.g. heart disease, lung disease, diabetes). If you are at higher risk, avoid all cruise travel and non-essential air travel.  4. Do you have a plan for taking time off from work or school, in case you are told to stay home for 14 days for self-monitoring or if you get sick with COVID-19?  You may be asked to take time off, and be unable to go to work or school until you are considered non-infectious.  5. Do you live with someone who is older or has a serious, chronic medical condition?  If you get sick with COVID-19 while you travel, your family, friends, loved ones may be at risk of infection.  6. Is COVID-19 spreading where I live when I return from travel?  Consider the risk of passing COVID-19 to others during travel - especially if you'll be in contact with people who are older adults or have a severe  chronic health condition. These people are at higher risk of getting very sick. If your symptoms are mild, or you don't have a fever, you may not even realize you are infectious and pass it on unknowningly.

We are still learning how COVID-19 spreads. Currently, we think the virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from close contact with a person who has COVID-19 - likely through respiratory droplets that are produced when a sick person coughs or sneezes. This is like how the flu spreads. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of nearby people, and inhaled into lungs. As such, it does not seem like this type of a spread will be that much of a concern after death.  That being said, one could get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it, and then touching their face (like their mouth, nose, or eyes). However, we do not think this is the main way in which this virus is being spread.   Older people (over the age of 65) and those with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness. There may be less of a chance of getting the illness by holding the hand or hugging the deceased body after it has been prepared for viewing. Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, after, and during the body being prepared. If washing and shrouding the body are important cultural and religious practices, families should work with their community culutural and religous leaders as well as funeral home staff on how to reduce exposure as much as possible. It is recommended that those conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves.
