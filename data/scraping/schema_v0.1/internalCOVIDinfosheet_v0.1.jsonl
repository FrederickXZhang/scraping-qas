If you do need to travel , please consider the following :   1 . Is COVID-19 spreading in the area where you 're going ? If it is , you may be more likely to get infected if you travel there than if you stay at home .   2 . Will you or your travel companions be in close contact with others during your trip ?   Your risk increases in crowded settings , especially closed - in settings that do not have good circulation . This includes conferences , concerts , etc .   3 . Are you or your travel companion more likely to get severe illness if you get COVID-19 ?   People at higher risk for severe disease are older adults and people of any age with serious chronic medical conditions ( e.g. heart disease , lung disease , diabetes ) . If you are at higher risk , avoid all cruise travel and non - essential air travel .   4 . Do you have a plan for taking time off from work or school , in case you are told to stay home for 14 days for self - monitoring or if you get sick with COVID-19 ?   You may be asked to take time off , and be unable to go to work or school until you are considered non - infectious .   5 . Do you live with someone who is older or has a serious , chronic medical condition ?   If you get sick with COVID-19 while you travel , your family , friends , loved ones may be at risk of infection .   6 . Is COVID-19 spreading where I live when I return from travel ?   Consider the risk of passing COVID-19 to others during travel - especially if you 'll be in contact with people who are older adults or have a severe   chronic health condition . These people are at higher risk of getting very sick . If your symptoms are mild , or you do n't have a fever , you may not even realize you are infectious and pass it on unknowingly .

We are still learning how COVID-19 spreads . Currently , we think the virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from close contact with a person who has COVID-19 - likely through respiratory droplets that are produced when a sick person coughs or sneezes .

As such , it does not seem like this type of a spread will be that much of a concern after death .   That being said , one could get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it , and then touching their face ( like their mouth , nose , or eyes ) . However , we do not think this is the main way in which this virus is being spread .    Older people ( over the age of 65 ) and those with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness . There may be less of a chance of getting the illness by holding the hand or hugging the deceased body after it has been prepared for viewing . Other activities , such as kissing , washing , and shrouding should be avoided before , after , and during the body being prepared . If washing and shrouding the body are important cultural and religious practices , families should work with their community cultural and religious leaders as well as funeral home staff on how to reduce exposure as much as possible .
