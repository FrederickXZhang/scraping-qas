It can spread from person to person if you inhale an infected person's respiratory droplets when they sneezes, coughs, or talk. It can also spead if you touch something that an infected person has touched, like a door knob, elevator button, or bathroom faucet.  That's why it's important to wash your hands, avoid touching your face, and practice social distancing to avoid getting sick. That's why it's also important to self-isolate and wear a mask around other household members if you are sick to avoid infecting other people.

Prevent the spread. If possible, have the sick household member use a separate room and bathroom. Have the sick person stay away from other people and pets as much as they can.  Don't share personal items like towels, dishes, and food. If the person needs to be around other people, they should wear a facemask. If they cannot wear a facemask, others should wear one while in the same room. The sick person should stay at home except to get medical care.   To protect yourself, avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. Disinfect all surfaces that are touched often, like tabletops and doorknobs, using cleaning sprays or wipes. If laundry is soiled, wear disposable gloves and keep laundry away from your body while washing. Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use alcohol-based hand sanitizer that is at least 60% alcohol.    2. Treat symptoms. Most people  with COVID-19 can get better with rest and drinking plenty of fluids. Symptoms usually last a few days and get better after a week. Keep track of symptoms, especially fevers.   3. Monitor for emergency signs. Contact a health care provider right away if they have one of these severe symptoms: -Trouble breathing  -Shortness of breath  -Chest pain or pressure that won't go away -Feeling very tired or unable to wake up from sleeping -Lips or face look blue  If someone in your house has one of these severe symptoms or something that worries you, please contact your medical provider.

It is important to limit travel as much as possible.   If you think you need to travel, please go through these questions:   1. Is COVID-19 spreading in the area where you're going?  If it is, you may be more likely to get infected if you travel there than if you stay at home.   2. Will you or the people who you are traveling with be in close contact with others during your trip?  Your risk increases in crowded settings, especially closed-in settings that do not have good circulation. This includes conferences, concerts, etc.   3. Are you or your travel companion more likely to get severe illness if you get COVID-19?  People at higher risk for severe disease are older adults and people of any age with serious chronic medical conditions (e.g. heart disease, lung disease, diabetes). If you are at higher risk, avoid all cruise travel and non-essential air travel.   4. Do you have a plan for taking time off from work or school, in case you are told to stay home for 14 days for self-monitoring or if you get sick with COVID-19?  You may be asked to take time off, and be unable to go to work or school until you are considered non-infectious.   5. Do you live with someone who is older or has a serious, chronic medical condition?  If you get sick with COVID-19 while you travel, your family, friends, loved ones may be at risk of getting sick. People who are older and who have health problems are more likely to get very sick.  6. Is COVID-19 spreading where I live when I return from travel?  Even if you don't feel sick right now, you could pass on COVID-19 to others during travel without knowing it. This is very important if you'll be in contact with people who are older adults or have a severe chronic health problem. These people are at higher risk of getting very sick.   It is important to go through these questions to decide if it makes sense to travel.

Play the Sale: Look for discounts, coupons, and sales, especially on store brands, which usually cost less.  Go Big: Buy in bulk when you can (e.g., purchase a whole chicken instead of just chicken breasts). Freeze what you don’t immediately need.  Go Home: If you have time, prepare food yourself instead of buying prepared or frozen meals. Thirty minutes will give you enough time to bring together simple, tasty meals.  Read the Fine Print: Compare unit prices (dollars per pound or per ounce) listed on price tags to find the cheapest brand.
