Respiratory droplets may also be passed from person-to-person through commonly used surfaces such as door knobs, elevator buttons and bathroom faucets.  [[Would you like more information about how COVID-19 spreads?]] How easily a virus spreads from person-to-person can vary. Some viruses are highly contagious (spread easily), like measles, while other viruses do not spread as easily. Another factor is whether the spread is sustained, meaning the virus spreads continually without stopping. The virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community  [[Would you like more information about how you can avoid getting infected with the virus that causes COVID-19?]] Socially distancing is a practice that aims to prevent those who are sick from coming into contact with those who are healthy. This is to reduce the opportunity for disease transmission. It means avoiding crowds, mass gatherings, and maintaining at least a 6 foot physical distance from others. This means no handshakes, hugs, or high-fives. It is also important to practice frequent hand-washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap is not available, you may use an alcohol-based (at least 60%) hand sanitizer.", "containsURLs": false, "questionUUID": "bfebd874-7854-11ea-88ae-9801a78e188f", "answerUUID": "bfebd8fe-7854-11ea-abf3-9801a78e188f", "exampleUUID": "bfebd958-7854-11ea-aece-9801a78e188f", "topic": "Spread/Transmission"}

If it is, you may be more likely to get infected if you travel there than if you stay at home.   2.

People at higher risk for severe disease are older adults and people of any age with serious chronic medical conditions (e.g. heart disease, lung disease, diabetes). If you are at higher risk, avoid all cruise travel and non-essential air travel.   4.

Even if you don't feel sick right now, you could pass on COVID-19 to others during travel without knowing it. This is very important if you'll be in contact with people who are older adults or have a severe chronic health problem. These people are at higher risk of getting very sick.

We are still learning how COVID-19 spreads. Currently, we think the virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from close contact with a person who has COVID-19 - likely through respiratory droplets that are produced when a sick person coughs or sneezes. This is like how the flu spreads. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of nearby people, and inhaled into lungs. As such, it does not seem like this type of a spread will be that much of a concern after death.  That being said, one could get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it, and then touching their face (like their mouth, nose, or eyes). However, we do not think this is the main way in which this virus is being spread.   Older people (over the age of 65) and those with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness. There may be less of a chance of getting the illness by holding the hand or hugging the deceased body after it has been prepared for viewing. Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, after, and during the body being prepared. If washing and shrouding the body are important cultural and religious practices, families should work with their community cultural and religious leaders as well as funeral home staff on how to reduce exposure as much as possible.
