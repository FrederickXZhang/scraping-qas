What masks can be useful in for the general public is reducing the amount of times a person touches their face, which means less opportunity for COVID19 to enter their body. This is because the mask is covering a significant amount of a person's face (namely the mouth and nose).

However, these is a shortage of available face masks for health workers - which is dangerous as they are on the frontlines of this pandemic.   [[Would you like more information about face masks?]] There are currently not enough face masks for health workers to use, which is dangerous as they are on the frontlines of this pandemic.

If it is, you may be more likely to get infected if you travel there than if you stay at home.  2. Will you or your travel companions be in close contact with others during your trip?

Do you have a plan for taking time off from work or school, in case you are told to stay home for 14 days for self-monitoring or if you get sick with COVID-19?  You may be asked to take time off, and be unable to go to work or school until you are considered non-infectious.  5.

Consider the risk of passing COVID-19 to others during travel - especially if you'll be in contact with people who are older adults or have a severe  chronic health condition.

We are still learning how COVID-19 spreads. Currently, we think the virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from close contact with a person who has COVID-19 - likely through respiratory droplets that are produced when a sick person coughs or sneezes. This is like how the flu spreads. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of nearby people, and inhaled into lungs. As such, it does not seem like this type of a spread will be that much of a concern after death.  That being said, one could get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it, and then touching their face (like their mouth, nose, or eyes). However, we do not think this is the main way in which this virus is being spread.   Older people (over the age of 65) and those with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness. There may be less of a chance of getting the illness by holding the hand or hugging the deceased body after it has been prepared for viewing. Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, after, and during the body being prepared. If washing and shrouding the body are important cultural and religious practices, families should work with their community cultural and religious leaders as well as funeral home staff on how to reduce exposure as much as possible.

For COVID-19, that would mean allowing enough people (who, ideally, are younger and healthier) to get mildly sick to develop immunity and reduce the person-to-person spread.   However, by choosing this option, that means many people will become sick with COVID-19, leading to more hospitalizations, an overburdened healthcare system, and more deaths. There is also still a lot that we do not know about COVID-19, including how long the immunity lasts.

Older people (over the age of 65) and those with underlying medical problems (e.g. high blood pressure, heart problems, diabetes) are more likely to get seriously ill.
