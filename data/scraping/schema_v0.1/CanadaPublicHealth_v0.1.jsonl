Wearing a non-medical mask (for example a homemade cloth mask) in the community has not been proven to protect the person wearing it. Strict hygiene and public health measures, including frequent hand washing and physical (social) distancing, will reduce your chance of being exposed to the virus. Wearing a non-medical mask is an additional measure you can take to protect others around you, even if you have no symptoms. It can be useful for short periods of time, when physical distancing is not possible in public settings such as when grocery shopping or using public transit. Wearing a non-medical mask is another way to cover your mouth and nose to prevent your respiratory droplets from contaminating others or landing on surfaces. Just like our recommendation not to cough into your hands (instead, cover your cough with tissues or your sleeve), a mask can reduce the chance that others are coming into contact with your respiratory droplets. If wearing a non-medical mask makes you feel safer and stops you from touching your nose and mouth, that is also good. But remember not to touch or rub your eyes. It is important to understand that non-medical masks have limitations and need to be used safely. Non-medical masks or facial coverings should not be placed on: \nchildren under age 2\nanyone who has trouble breathing\nanyone who is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance\n If you choose to use a non-medical face mask: \nyou must wash your hands immediately before putting it on and immediately after taking it off (in addition to practising good hand hygiene while wearing it)\nit should fit well (non-gaping)\nyou should not share it with others\n Face masks can become contaminated on the outside, or when touched by your hands. When wearing a mask, take the following precautions to protect yourself: \navoid touching your face mask while using it\nchange a cloth mask as soon as it gets damp or soiled\r\n    \nput it directly into the washing machine or a bag that can be emptied into the washing machine and then disposed of\ncloth masks can be laundered with other items using a hot cycle, and then dried thoroughly\n\n\nnon-medical masks that cannot be washed should be discarded and replaced as soon as they get damp, soiled or crumpled\r\n    \ndispose of masks properly in a lined garbage bin\ndo not leave discarded masks in shopping carts, on the ground, etc.\n\n\n Non-medical masks alone will not prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Now and always during cold and flu season, stay home if you are sick. Encourage those you know are sick to stay home until they no longer have symptoms. Since respiratory viruses, such as the one that causes COVID-19, are spread through contact, change how you greet one another. Instead of a handshake, a kiss or a hug, a friendly wave or elbow bump is less likely to expose you to respiratory viruses. Practise frequent hygiene, which includes proper hand washing and coughing and sneezing etiquette. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces, such as toys and door handles. These are the most important ways that you can protect yourself and your family from respiratory illness, including COVID-19. \nMake a plan\nIf COVID-19 becomes common in your community, you will want to have thought about how to change your behaviours and routines to reduce the risk of infection.\nYour plan should include how you can change your regular habits to reduce your exposure to crowded places. For example, you may:\n\ndo your grocery shopping at off-peak hours\ncommute by public transit outside of the busy rush hour\nopt to exercise outdoors instead of in an indoor fitness class\n\nYour plan should also include what you will do if you become sick. If you are a caregiver of children or other dependents, you will want to have thought ahead to engage backup caregivers.\nYou should also think about what you will do if a member of your family becomes sick and needs care. Talk to your employer about working from home if you are needed to care for a family member at home.\nIf you become ill, stay home until you are no longer showing symptoms. Employers should not require a sick leave note as that will put added pressure on limited health care services.\nYour plan should include shopping for supplies that you should have on hand at all times. This will ensure you do not need to leave your home while you are sick or busy caring for an ill family member.\nYour plan should build on the kits you have prepared for other potential emergencies. For more information on how to prepare yourself and your family in the event of an emergency, please visit GetPrepared.ca.\n \nFill your prescriptions\nRefill your prescriptions now so that you do not have to go to a busy pharmacy if you do become sick. Consider seeing your health care provider to renew your prescriptions ahead of time.\n \nStock up on essentials but avoid panic buying\nAt this time, it makes sense to fill your cupboards with non-perishable food items, so that you do not need to go shopping if you become sick.\nIt is easier on the supply chain if people gradually build up their household stores instead of making large-scale purchases all at once. To do this, you can add a few extra items to your grocery cart every time you shop. Good options are easy-to-prepare foods like:\n\ndried pasta and sauce\nprepared canned soups\ncanned vegetables and beans\n\nIt is also a good idea to have extra stores of:\n\npet food\ntoilet paper\nfacial tissue\nfeminine hygiene products\ndiapers (if you have children who use them)\n\nThe reason for stocking up on these items is not necessarily because you will need to self-isolate. Having these supplies on hand will ensure you do not need to leave your home at the peak of the outbreak or if you become ill.\n \nHow to care for those who are ill\nIf you or a member of your family become ill with COVID-19, there are precautions that should be taken in the home. Your health care provider will advise you if hospital care is more appropriate. \nChildren who have mild COVID-19 symptoms are able to stay at home with a caregiver throughout their recovery without needing hospitalization. If you are caring for a child who has suspected or probable COVID-19, it is important to follow the advice for caregivers. This advice will help you protect yourself, others in your home, as well as others in the community.\nTo prepare for these potential situations, you should have on hand:\n\nsoap\nfacial tissue\npaper towels\nalcohol-based hand sanitizer\nhousehold cleaning products\nregular detergents for washing dishes and doing laundry\nfever-reducing medications, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen\r\n      \nthis includes products for children if you are a parent or caregiver\n\n\nplastic garbage bags for containing soiled tissues and other waste\ndiluted bleach, prepared according to the instructions on the label, or in a ratio of 1 teaspoon (5 mL) per cup (250 mL)\r\n      \nthis assumes bleach is 5% sodium hypochlorite, to give a 0.1% sodium hypochlorite solution\n\n\n\n \nGet reliable information\nMake sure that you get high-quality information about COVID-19 from reliable sources. The Public Health Agency of Canada is a reliable source of information, as are provincial and territorial public health authorities.\nIf you are finding that the news media is making you feel anxious, take a break from it.\n \nCommunicate with family, friends and neighbours\nLet your family, friends and neighbours know that you are making plans to prepare for COVID-19. Share your plan with them, as this might motivate them to make their own.\nTalk to them about a buddy system in which you agree to check in on each other and run essential errands if you become sick.", "containsURLs": false, "questionUUID": "643799ee-79df-11ea-8d74-8c85901aafa7", "answerUUID": "64379b58-79df-11ea-b687-8c85901aafa7", "exampleUUID": "64379bf6-79df-11ea-bf23-8c85901aafa7", "topic": ""}

Some of the physical distancing measures need extensive preparation. Community planners should prepare for:  \ninterruptions in social supports\nreduction in public services like transit and access to community centres\nfinancial consequences from the reduction of services or cancelled events\n Planners, administrators and employers must work together to put into effect community-based measures to protect: \ngroups\nemployees\nthe general population \n \nAvoiding crowds\nRespiratory illnesses like COVID-19 spread quickly in crowded spaces. Avoiding crowds can reduce the spread of infection. This type of precaution could have a significant impact on how a community functions. \nCommunities should plan ahead and consider:\n\nwhether to shut down public transit\r\n      \nif public transit is shut down, ensure transportation remains available for:\r\n          \ncritical infrastructure workers\nemergency medical services or treatments like dialysis and chemotherapy\n\n\n\n\nworking with employers and businesses to put into effect staggered work hours\r\n      \nthis reduces crowding on public transit during peak commuting hours and in large workplaces during normal workday hours\n\n\nvoluntary quarantine of a community based on a risk assessment\nwhether to ask individuals, organizations and businesses to cancel or postpone mass gatherings, such as:\r\n      \nfunerals\nweddings\nreligious services\nconcerts, conferences, sporting events and other forms of entertainment\n\n\nrequiring people to stay home from school, work or other community settings, such as shopping centres and movie theatres.\n\n \nMass gatherings\nMass gatherings are settings or events where large numbers of people may be in close contact. If they are not planned and managed carefully, they can contribute to the transmission of respiratory pathogens, such as the virus that causes COVID-19. This can cause additional strain on the health care system during outbreaks.\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada recommends that event organizers and planners cancel or postpone in-person gatherings in alignment with the recommendations of their local public health authorities. Where possible, they should offer virtual or online alternatives. \nAside from cancelling or postponing an event, other measures to reduce infection risks during mass gatherings include:\n\navoiding shaking hands\npractising proper hygiene\navoiding common sleeping areas\ndiscouraging attendees from sharing food or drinks\nincreasing physical distance between others (ideally to 2 metres) by:\r\n      \nbroadcasting events\noffering virtual participation \nmoving the venue from indoors to outdoors\n\n\neliminating self-serve buffet style eating at social or religious gatherings\nencouraging ill people and people who are at risk for severe illness not to attend gatherings\nsupporting hand hygiene by providing hand sanitizers dispensers in prominent locations\nensuring event organizers have arrangements in place to safely isolate and transport people who become ill onsite\ncommunicating clearly to attendees about the risks and directing them to our advice on reducing the spread of illness \n\n \nRemote and isolated communities\nCommunities that are remote or isolated should consider stocking up on needed supplies like food and medicine.
