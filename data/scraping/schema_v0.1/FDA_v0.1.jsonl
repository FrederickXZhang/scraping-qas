The use of facemasks is also crucial for health workers and people who are taking care of someone in close settings (at home or in a health care facility).\n\nWash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty. For information about handwashing, see CDC’s Handwashing website.\nClean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.\n\tUse disinfectants appropriate for the surface. Most common EPA-registered household disinfectants will work. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application method and contact time, etc.).\n\nView the current list of products that meet EPA’s criteria for use against SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19. \n\n\nTo use household bleach to disinfect surfaces, mix: \n\n5 tablespoons (1/3rd cup) bleach per gallon of water.\n\t\t\tOR\n\n\n4 teaspoons bleach per quart of water Follow manufacturer’s instructions for application and proper ventilation. Check to ensure the product is not past its expiration date. Never mix household bleach with ammonia or any other cleanser.
