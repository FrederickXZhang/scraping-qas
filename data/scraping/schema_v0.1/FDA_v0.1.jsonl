Some coronaviruses cause cold-like illnesses in people, while others cause illness in certain types of animals, such as cattle, camels, and bats. Some coronaviruses, such as canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals and do not infect humans. For example, bovine coronavirus causes diarrhea in young calves, and pregnant cows are routinely vaccinated to help prevent infection in calves. This vaccine is only licensed for use in cattle for bovine coronavirus and is not licensed to prevent COVID-19 in cattle or other species, including humans.\nDogs can get a respiratory coronavirus, which is part of the complex of viruses and bacteria associated with canine infectious respiratory disease, commonly known as “kennel cough.” While this virus is highly contagious among both domestic and wild dogs, it is not transmitted to other animal species or humans.\nMost strains of feline enteric coronavirus, a gastrointestinal form, are fought off by a cat’s immune system without causing disease. However, in a small proportion of these cats, the virus can cause feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a disease that is almost always fatal.\nOther species, like horses, turkeys, chickens, and swine, can contract their own species-specific strains of coronavirus but, like the other strains mentioned above, they are not known to be transmissible to humans.

What is FDA’s GFI #269 - Enforcement Policy Regarding Federal Veterinary-Client-Patient Relationship (VCPR) Requirements to Facilitate Veterinary Telemedicine During the COVID-19 Outbreak?", "answerText": "A. On March 24, 2020, the FDA issued this guidance to facilitate veterinarians’ ability to provide veterinary telemedicine services during the COVID-19 pandemic. \nThe agency intends to temporarily suspend enforcement of portions of the federal veterinarian-client-patient relationship (VCPR) requirements relevant to certain FDA regulations. The VCPR is the professional relationship between the veterinarian, client (e.g., animal owner or caretaker), and the animal patient(s). The federal VCPR definition requires that veterinarians physically examine animal patients and/or make medically appropriate and timely visits to the location where the animals are kept. Therefore, the federal VCPR definition cannot be met solely through telemedicine.\nTo help veterinarians utilize telemedicine to address animal health needs during the COVID-19 pandemic, FDA does not intend to enforce the animal examination and premises visit portion of the VCPR requirements relevant to FDA regulations governing Extralabel Drug Use in Animals and Veterinary Feed Directive (VFD) drugs. This will allow veterinarians to prescribe drugs in an extralabel manner or authorize the use of VFD drugs without direct examination of or making visits to their patients, which will limit person-to-person interaction and the potential spread of COVID-19 in the community.\nGiven the temporary nature of this policy, the FDA plans to reassess it periodically and revise or withdraw this guidance as necessary.", "containsURLs": false, "questionUUID": "1ac0c41c-8028-11ea-9d37-8c85901aafa7", "answerUUID": "1ac0c4ba-8028-11ea-bd76-8c85901aafa7", "exampleUUID": "1ac0c51e-8028-11ea-b3ce-8c85901aafa7", "topic": ""}
