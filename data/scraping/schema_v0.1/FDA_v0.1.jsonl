However, in a small proportion of these cats, the virus can cause feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a disease that is almost always fatal.\nOther species, like horses, turkeys, chickens, and swine, can contract their own species-specific strains of coronavirus but, like the other strains mentioned above, they are not known to be transmissible to humans.

Because COVID-19 is spreading rapidly from person to person, availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) for human healthcare professionals exposed to COVID-19 cases is critical. The FDA is aware that as the COVID-19 outbreak continues to expand globally, the supply chain for these devices will continue to be stressed as demand exceeds available supplies. The FDA has received information from healthcare organizations that some distributors may have placed certain types of PPE on allocation, basing the quantity available to the healthcare organization on previous usage, not projected use. Increased use may exceed the available supply of PPE, resulting in shortages at some healthcare organizations.\nThe FDA recommends conservation strategies for use by healthcare organizations and personnel—categorized for a range of clinical needs and supply levels—intended to assist healthcare organizations in determining conservation procedures during this time. The FDA’s recommendations are intended to augment, and not intended to replace, specific controls and procedures developed by health care organizations, CDC, or CDC’s Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) to aid in infection prevention and control.\nThe FDA is collaborating with manufacturers of surgical masks and gowns to better understand the current supply chain issues related to the COVID-19 outbreak, and to avoid any widespread shortages of these products.\nThe FDA will continue to keep healthcare providers, manufacturers, and the public informed if new or additional information becomes available.", "containsURLs": false, "questionUUID": "ed20bae8-7b41-11ea-951c-8c85901aafa7", "answerUUID": "ed20bbba-7b41-11ea-9434-8c85901aafa7", "exampleUUID": "ed20bc28-7b41-11ea-90c3-8c85901aafa7", "topic": ""}

What is FDA’s GFI #269 - Enforcement Policy Regarding Federal Veterinary-Client-Patient Relationship (VCPR) Requirements to Facilitate Veterinary Telemedicine During the COVID-19 Outbreak?", "answerText": "A. On March 24, 2020, the FDA issued this guidance to facilitate veterinarians’ ability to provide veterinary telemedicine services during the COVID-19 pandemic. \nThe agency intends to temporarily suspend enforcement of portions of the federal veterinarian-client-patient relationship (VCPR) requirements relevant to certain FDA regulations. The VCPR is the professional relationship between the veterinarian, client (e.g., animal owner or caretaker), and the animal patient(s). The federal VCPR definition requires that veterinarians physically examine animal patients and/or make medically appropriate and timely visits to the location where the animals are kept. Therefore, the federal VCPR definition cannot be met solely through telemedicine.\nTo help veterinarians utilize telemedicine to address animal health needs during the COVID-19 pandemic, FDA does not intend to enforce the animal examination and premises visit portion of the VCPR requirements relevant to FDA regulations governing Extralabel Drug Use in Animals and Veterinary Feed Directive (VFD) drugs. This will allow veterinarians to prescribe drugs in an extralabel manner or authorize the use of VFD drugs without direct examination of or making visits to their patients, which will limit person-to-person interaction and the potential spread of COVID-19 in the community.\nGiven the temporary nature of this policy, the FDA plans to reassess it periodically and revise or withdraw this guidance as necessary.", "containsURLs": false, "questionUUID": "ed20f3dc-7b41-11ea-bb4a-8c85901aafa7", "answerUUID": "ed20f54c-7b41-11ea-af10-8c85901aafa7", "exampleUUID": "ed20f5f8-7b41-11ea-a2cf-8c85901aafa7", "topic": ""}
