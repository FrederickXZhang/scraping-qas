And then you would re-institute as the cases go up again. But we’re basically looking at doing this over and over and over again, even after a five-month period of strict social distancing, in order to curb cases until we have a vaccine.”\nHealth officials say we’re at least a year away from the first publicly available coronavirus vaccine.

You’ll touch your mouth. You’ll rub your eyes. And then you’ll touch other surfaces, and then you will be spreading virus if you are infected and shedding asymptomatically.”\nDoctors stress that the best way to prevent getting coronavirus is not by wearing face masks, since they often cause more harm than good. \nInstead, people should wash their hands with soap and water frequently for at least 20 seconds and stop touching their faces – which is harder than it sounds.\n", "hasAnswer": true, "targetEducationLevel": "NA", "extraData": {"Tag: Why is everyone stocking up on bottled water?

If you’re sick or live in an area where an outbreak has been reported, avoid it. \nMass transit could increase your risk of exposure to coronavirus. Many transit systems are upping their cleaning regimens — notably the New York subway system. \nDr. Robyn Gershon, a professor of epidemiology at New York University’s School of Public Health, has some tips: When you ride a bus or subway, sneeze or cough into your elbow. Use a tissue to hold onto a pole. Avoid touching your face while you’re riding, and use hand sanitizer if you have it while you’re commuting. \nAgain, wash your hands before, during and after your trip. \nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo recommends letting crowded trains or buses pass and waiting for a less crowded one. It’s nearly impossible to maintain 6 feet of distance on a packed subway car. \nIf you have a chronic illness, find alternative means of transport — being in a crowded subway car or bus will significantly increase your risk of infection.\n", "hasAnswer": true, "targetEducationLevel": "NA", "extraData": {"Tag: Why is everyone stocking up on bottled water?

But now, many hospitals are “absolutely full,” Schaffner said. “We have under-built hospital beds because they are very expensive.”\nAlso, Americans have grown accustomed to “just-in-time” ordering. But that becomes a huge problem when international supply chains are disrupted by an outbreak. “We didn’t anticipate international turbulence influencing this,” Schaffner said.\nNow, some health care workers are making their own masks.

This happened because the Trump administration refused to allocate money to a program that started during the 2014 Ebola outbreak. \nFormer CDC director Dr. Tom Frieden warned that move “would significantly increase the chance an epidemic will spread without our knowledge and endanger lives in our country and around the world.”\nProblems with the testing Malfunctions, shortages and delays in availability have all contributed to the slowdown. \nIn the first few weeks of the outbreak in the US, the CDC was the only facility in the country that could confirm test results — even though a World Health Organization test became available around the same time. \nSome test kits that were sent around the country were flawed — a move that put the US behind about “four to five weeks,” says Dr. Rob Davidson, executive director of the Committee to Protect Medicare.\n", "hasAnswer": true, "targetEducationLevel": "NA", "extraData": {"Tag: Why is everyone stocking up on bottled water?

The original version of the book called the strain the “Gorki-400,” in reference to a Russian locality, before it was later changed to the “Wuhan-400.” In the book, the virus was man-made, while scientists believe the novel coronavirus started in animals and jumped to humans.

By March 26 , the US had more than 78,000 cases of coronavirus , and at least 1,135 people have died . \n  Since this flu season started October 1 , more than 23,000 Americans have died from the flu , according to CDC estimates . Nationwide , the flu has infected at least 34 million people between October and mid - March . \n  But here are key differences when comparing the flu vs. coronavirus : \n\n  The CDC estimates for the flu go back to October 2019 . But the first US case of coronavirus did n’t emerge until several months later . \n  Coronavirus is twice as contagious as the flu . Research indicates a person with the flu infects an average of 1.28 other people , CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said . But with coronavirus , “ it ’s likely between two and three ” other people . \n  Coronavirus infections have a “ very high mortality rate – one in six – among people who are over 80 and people with underlying chronic disease , ” epidemiologist Dr. Abdul El - Sayed said . \n  People with coronavirus might not get symptoms for 14 days , and some get no symptoms at all . But during that time , they ’re still contagious and can infect others unknowingly . \n  A vaccine is available for the flu , but no vaccine is available for coronavirus . Experts say the number of flu deaths could be drastically reduced if more people got their flu shots . But about half of Americans do n’t get vaccinated , including most children who die from the flu .", "hasAnswer": true, "targetEducationLevel": "NA", "extraData": {"What percentage of people with coronavirus don't have symptoms?

Nationwide , the flu has infected at least 34 million people between October and mid - March . \n But here are key differences when comparing the flu vs. coronavirus : \n\n The CDC estimates for the flu go back to October 2019 . But the first US case of coronavirus did n’t emerge until several months later . \n Coronavirus is twice as contagious as the flu . Research indicates a person with the flu infects an average of 1.28 other people , CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said . But with coronavirus , “ it ’s likely between two and three ” other people . \n Coronavirus infections have a “ very high mortality rate – one in six – among people who are over 80 and people with underlying chronic disease , ” epidemiologist Dr. Abdul El - Sayed said . \n People with coronavirus might not get symptoms for 14 days , and some get no symptoms at all . But during that time , they ’re still contagious and can infect others unknowingly . \n A vaccine is available for the flu , but no vaccine is available for coronavirus . Experts say the number of flu deaths could be drastically reduced if more people got their flu shots . But about half of Americans do n’t get vaccinated , including most children who die from the flu .", "answerLinks": {}}}
