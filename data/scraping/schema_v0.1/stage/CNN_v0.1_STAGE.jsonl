Nationwide , the flu has infected at least 34 million people between October and mid - March . \n  But here are key differences when comparing the flu vs. coronavirus : \n\n  The CDC estimates for the flu go back to October 2019 . But the first US case of coronavirus did n\u2019t emerge until several months later . \n  Coronavirus is twice as contagious as the flu . Research indicates a person with the flu infects an average of 1.28 other people , CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said . But with coronavirus , \u201c it \u2019s likely between two and three \u201d other people . \n  Coronavirus infections have a \u201c very high mortality rate \u2013 one in six \u2013 among people who are over 80 and people with underlying chronic disease , \u201d epidemiologist Dr. Abdul El - Sayed said . \n  People with coronavirus might not get symptoms for 14 days , and some get no symptoms at all . But during that time , they \u2019re still contagious and can infect others unknowingly . \n  A vaccine is available for the flu , but no vaccine is available for coronavirus .

Nationwide , the flu has infected at least 34 million people between October and mid - March . \n But here are key differences when comparing the flu vs. coronavirus : \n\n The CDC estimates for the flu go back to October 2019 . But the first US case of coronavirus did n\u2019t emerge until several months later . \n Coronavirus is twice as contagious as the flu . Research indicates a person with the flu infects an average of 1.28 other people , CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said . But with coronavirus , \u201c it \u2019s likely between two and three \u201d other people . \n Coronavirus infections have a \u201c very high mortality rate \u2013 one in six \u2013 among people who are over 80 and people with underlying chronic disease , \u201d epidemiologist Dr. Abdul El - Sayed said . \n People with coronavirus might not get symptoms for 14 days , and some get no symptoms at all . But during that time , they \u2019re still contagious and can infect others unknowingly . \n A vaccine is available for the flu , but no vaccine is available for coronavirus . Experts say the number of flu deaths could be drastically reduced if more people got their flu shots . But about half of Americans do n\u2019t get vaccinated , including most children who die from the flu .", "answerLinks": {}}}

But now , many hospitals are \u201c absolutely full , \u201d Schaffner said . \u201c We have under - built hospital beds because they are very expensive . \u201d \n  Also , Americans have grown accustomed to \u201c just - in - time \u201d ordering .

early testing . \n Problems with public health infrastructure Two years ago , the CDC stopped funding epidemic prevention activities in 39 countries , including China . This happened because the Trump administration refused to allocate money to a program that started during the 2014 Ebola outbreak . \n Former CDC director Dr. Tom Frieden warned that move \u201c would significantly increase the chance an epidemic will spread without our knowledge and endanger lives in our country and around the world . \u201d \n Problems with the testing Malfunctions , shortages and delays in availability have all contributed to the slowdown . \n In the first few weeks of the outbreak in the US , the CDC was the only facility in the country that could confirm test results \u2014 even though a World Health Organization test became available around the same time . \n Some test kits that were sent around the country were flawed \u2014 a move that put the US behind about \u201c four to five weeks , \u201d says Dr. Rob Davidson , executive director of the Committee to Protect Medicare .", "answerLinks": {}}}

There are some interesting coincidences in the 1981 fiction novel , which says \u201c a severe pneumonia - like illness will spread around the globe \u201d around the year 2020 . Modern editions of the book call the biological strain \u201c Wuhan-400 , \u201d and the current coronavirus outbreak started in Wuhan , China . \n  But there are important differences between the book and reality . The original version of the book called the strain the \u201c Gorki-400 , \u201d in reference to a Russian locality , before it was later changed to the \u201c Wuhan-400 . \u201d In the book , the virus was man - made , while scientists believe the novel coronavirus started in animals and jumped to humans . And in the book , the virus had a 100 % mortality rate . Early estimates of the mortality rate for this coronavirus outbreak range from 2 - 4 % .", "hasAnswer": true, "targetEducationLevel": "NA", "extraData": {"What percentage of people with coronavirus don't have symptoms?
