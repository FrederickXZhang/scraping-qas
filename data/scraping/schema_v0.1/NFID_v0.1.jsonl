It may also be transmitted when you touch a surface or object with the virus on it, then touch your mouth, nose, or eyes. It is important to avoid people who may be infected. Older adults and those with underlying health conditions that can put them at increased risk should stay home to avoid being around others. Nursing homes and retirement and long-term care facilities should halt social visits. The White House advises that all individuals avoid:  Gatherings of more than 10 people; Non-essential air travel, and; Cruise ships (Note that major cruise lines have suspended trips and others are restricting passengers over the age of 70);  For older adults and adults with underlying health conditions, the CDC advises taking extra measures to put distance between yourself and others including:  Staying home whenever possible; Considering ways to get food, medicines, and essentials delivered to your home;  This is an important advisory to follow, because there is currently no vaccine available to prevent COVID-19 and no specific antiviral medication to treat it. The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to the virus. Proper handwashing is also imperative to preventing COVID-19 infection and spread. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, sneezing, or being in a public place. If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol. As much as possible, avoid handshaking and touching high-traffic surfaces in public places–for example, elevator buttons, door handles, handrails, or counters. Use a tissue or your sleeve to cover your hand or finger if you must touch something. Avoid touching your face, nose, eyes, etc. To prevent the spread of the virus, it is important to stay home and avoid crowds. If you do need to go out in public, practice social distancing (stay at least 6 feet apart) and wear a cloth face covering to help prevent the spread of the disease to others. Surgical masks and N-95 respirators should not be used by the general public, as they are in short supply and should be used only by healthcare workers and caregivers who are taking care of infected individuals in close settings (at home or in a healthcare facility). Although there is no vaccine available to prevent COVID-19 at this time, you should still ensure that you and your family’s vaccinations are up to date, including influenza (flu) and pneumococcal (pneumonia) vaccines. This will help reduce the pressure on the healthcare system by reducing vaccine-preventable diseases.", "containsURLs": false, "questionUUID": "18ab535e-8028-11ea-a729-8c85901aafa7", "answerUUID": "18ab53fe-8028-11ea-ae6f-8c85901aafa7", "exampleUUID": "18ab5462-8028-11ea-b306-8c85901aafa7", "topic": ""}

Here are some simple ways to prepare: Ask your physician or local pharmacy if ordering your medicines online is an option. Many online pharmacies (including national chains) will fill valid prescriptions and ship them directly to your door allowing you to avoid going to the pharmacy in person. CMS is also working with private plans to waive prescription drug refill limits and to relax restrictions on home or mail delivery of prescription drugs. However, only order from a reputable online pharmacy. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns consumers about rogue online pharmacies that claim to sell prescription medicines at deeply discounted prices. Read the FDA warning here. If you have questions, call a healthcare professional. Also, be sure you have over-the-counter medicines and medical supplies (fever reducers, tissues, hydrating beverages, etc.) to treat fever and other symptoms. Have enough basic household items and groceries on hand so you are prepared to stay at home for an extended period of time. Most major grocery chains have made it possible to order groceries online and have them delivered to your door within hours or days. Check the websites of local or national grocery stores that may allow you to select your items online and then arrange for shipping. Keep in mind, however, that many of these services are experiencing delays due to the high volume of people choosing the safety of online ordering rather than in-person shopping. This means you will need to plan ahead. If you have questions or concerns about the delivery timeline, speak to a customer service representative. If you must go out for groceries, try to find a local grocery store that offers hours just for older adults. Most of these hours are earlier in the day and offer a chance for older adults to shop without as much exposure. Remember to stay vigilant with handwashing and avoid touching your eyes, mouth, and nose since the coronavirus can remain on some surfaces for hours and in some cases, days.", "containsURLs": false, "questionUUID": "18ab660a-8028-11ea-884c-8c85901aafa7", "answerUUID": "18ab669e-8028-11ea-b390-8c85901aafa7", "exampleUUID": "18ab66fa-8028-11ea-92e8-8c85901aafa7", "topic": ""}
