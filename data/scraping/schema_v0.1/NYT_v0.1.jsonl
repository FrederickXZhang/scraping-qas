One big private lender, Sallie Mae, said it is offering suspension of payment for up to three months, with no damage to a borrower’s credit.\nWith the stimulus package, there will be automatic payment suspensions for any student loan held by the federal government until Sept. 30.

Exact policies and requirements vary, though, so if you need help, you should call and ask.\nHousing There’s also a good chance you can delay your mortgage payment if the outbreak has left you short of money.
