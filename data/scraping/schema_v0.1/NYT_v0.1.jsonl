One big private lender, Sallie Mae, said it is offering suspension of payment for up to three months, with no damage to a borrower’s credit.\nWith the stimulus package, there will be automatic payment suspensions for any student loan held by the federal government until Sept. 30.

He said that a bill to allow remote voting during a national crisis, put forward by Senators Rob Portman and Richard Durbin, was \"a good start.\"\nSo far, congressional leaders have resisted calls for remote voting, calling it a bad precedent and saying they need to address the current crisis. They have instead looked for ways to practice social distancing within the Capitol. \"There's reason to be wary about a virtual Congress,\" Mr. Ornstein said, like ensuring cybersecurity and that Americans can still see and hear lawmakers at work.\nBut he added that House and Senate leaders, through legislation or rule changes, could create the capacity for remote voting only in the most extreme circumstances, such as when many members are incapacitated or transportation to the Capitol or an alternate meeting place becomes impossible.", "containsURLs": false, "questionUUID": "69fc20f4-79df-11ea-bc0d-8c85901aafa7", "answerUUID": "69fc2228-79df-11ea-9100-8c85901aafa7", "exampleUUID": "69fc22d2-79df-11ea-b8f4-8c85901aafa7", "topic": ""}
