One big private lender, Sallie Mae, said it is offering suspension of payment for up to three months, with no damage to a borrower’s credit.\nWith the stimulus package, there will be automatic payment suspensions for any student loan held by the federal government until Sept. 30. It may be hard to contact many of the loan servicers right now, so check your account online in the coming weeks. \nUtility bills Some utility providers are offering to stop cutting people off for nonpayment.

Exact policies and requirements vary, though, so if you need help, you should call and ask.\nHousing There’s also a good chance you can delay your mortgage payment if the outbreak has left you short of money.
