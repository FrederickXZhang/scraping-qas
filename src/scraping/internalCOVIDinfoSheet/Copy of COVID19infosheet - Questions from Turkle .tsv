What are the complications from Covid-19?	Complications from COVID-19 include pneumonia in both lungs, organ failure in several organs, and death. 			MayoClinic	
When is COVID19 going to stop?	Unfortunately, we do not know. There is still a lot to learn about COVID-19. Right now, it is best to practice social distancing, stay at home as much as possible, and practice frequent hand-washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If you do have to go out, maintain a 6 foot distance between yourself and others. 	Yes, if we have more information. 		CDC	
Will herd immunity be the only means of eradicating COVID-19? 	No, herd immunity is not the only way to eradicate COVID-19.   Herd immunity refers to when enough of the population is immune to an infectious disease (either through vaccinations and/or prior illness) that it makes it difficult for the disease to spread person to person - even if some people are not vaccinated. For COVID-19, that would mean allowing enough people (who, ideally, are younger and healthier) to get mildly sick to develop immunity and reduce the person-to-person spread.   However, by choosing this option, that means many people will become sick with COVID-19, leading to more hospitalizations, an overburdened healthcare system, and more deaths. There is also still a lot that we do not know about COVID-19, including how long the immunity lasts.   Right now, it is best to practice social distancing, stay at home as much as possible, and practice frequent hand-washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If you do have to go out, maintain a 6 foot distance between yourself and others.   			National Geographic

How long are you contagious for if you have COVID-19? 	It varies as decisions about when one can be released from isolation are made on a case-by-case basis. If you have been released from isolation, then you are no longer considered to pose a risk of infection to others. To be released from isolation, one must meet all of the following requirements:  1. the patient is free from fever without use of fever-reducing medications.  2. the patient is no longer showing symptoms, including the cough. 3. the patient has tested negative on at least two consecutive respiratory specimens collected at least 24 hours apart. 	Yes, if this changes based on new information. 		CDC	
Is the virus infectious during incubation period? 	Yes, it is infectious during incubation period. If you are displaying COVID-19 symptoms, please self-isolate. If you think you might have had exposure to COVID-19, please quarantine yourself as you could be asymptomatic (have no symptoms).

Do I have COVID-19? 	The only way to know if you have COVID-19 is to get tested. However, not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19. If you are exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms, or have been exposed to those who have it, then it is recommended to seek testing.   "The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny-nose, sore throat, or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people may also become infected and don't develop any symptoms or feel unwell (also known as being asymptomatic). Symptoms appear between 1-14 days after exposure to COVID-19.   Older people (over the age of 65) and those with underlying medical problems (e.g. high blood pressure, heart problems, diabetes) are more likely to get seriously ill.  If symptoms are severe - like having persistent pain/pressure in chest, new confusion or inability to arouse, or bluish lips or face, contact healthcare provider or go to the emergency room - it is important to seek care immediately.			WHO	
Is the COVID-19 test anonymous? 	If you test positive for COVID-19, that will be reported to public health authorities. This is so that they can track the outbreak, and alert others who also might have been exposed. 			CDC	
Which hospital takes the COVID-19 test? 	If you have the symptoms of COVID-19 and want to get tested, call your local health department or a medical provider. Please note that while test supplies are increasing, it may be difficult to find a place to get tested.

Should I stay home and even avoid going to the supermarket and drugstore? 	Yes, you can go to the supermarket and drugstore, but it is important to go during off-peak hours when less people will be there. It is also important to reduce the amount of times you need to go, as we want to practice social distancing, and stay at home as much as possible.This is to prevent those who are sick from coming into contact with those who are healthy, and reduce the opportunity for COVID-19 to spread further.
