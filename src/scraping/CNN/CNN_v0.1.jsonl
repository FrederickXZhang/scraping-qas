Luckily, transit systems are upping their cleaning regimens \u2014 notably the New York subway system. \nDr. Robyn Gershon, a professor of epidemiology at New York University\u2019s School of Public Health, has some tips: When you ride a bus or subway, sneeze or cough into your elbow. Use a tissue to hold onto a pole. Avoid touching your face while you\u2019re riding, and use hand sanitizer if you have it while you\u2019re commuting. \nAgain, wash your hands before, during and after your trip. \nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo recommends letting crowded trains or buses pass and waiting for a less crowded one. It\u2019s nearly impossible to maintain 6 feet of distance on a packed subway car. \nIf you have a chronic illness, find alternative means of transportation \u2014 being in a crowded subway car or bus will significantly increase your risk of infection.\n", "hasAnswer": true, "targetEducationLevel": "NA", "extraData": {"Tag: Why is everyone stocking up on bottled water?

If you\u2019re sick or live in an area where an outbreak has been reported, avoid it. \nMass transit could increase your risk of exposure to coronavirus. Many transit systems are upping their cleaning regimens \u2014 notably the New York subway system. \nDr. Robyn Gershon, a professor of epidemiology at New York University\u2019s School of Public Health, has some tips: When you ride a bus or subway, sneeze or cough into your elbow. Use a tissue to hold onto a pole. Avoid touching your face while you\u2019re riding, and use hand sanitizer if you have it while you\u2019re commuting. \nAgain, wash your hands before, during and after your trip. \nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo recommends letting crowded trains or buses pass and waiting for a less crowded one. It\u2019s nearly impossible to maintain 6 feet of distance on a packed subway car. \nIf you have a chronic illness, find alternative means of transport \u2014 being in a crowded subway car or bus will significantly increase your risk of infection.\n", "hasAnswer": true, "targetEducationLevel": "NA", "extraData": {"Tag: Why is everyone stocking up on bottled water?

But the pneumonia vaccine won\u2019t help.\n\u201cVaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, only help protect people from these specific bacterial infections,\u201d according to Harvard Medical School.\n\u201cThey do not protect against any coronavirus pneumonia.\u201d\nFor now, health officials are urging the public to get the flu vaccine. The flu shot does not protect against coronavirus, but it does help protect against a massive and unnecessary burden on hospitals as they struggle to tackle coronavirus.\nThe CDC estimates about 140,000 to 810,000 people are hospitalized with the flu every year in the US. And about half of Americans don\u2019t get vaccinated \u2013 including most children who die from the flu.\n", "hasAnswer": true, "targetEducationLevel": "NA", "extraData": {"Tag: Why is everyone stocking up on bottled water?
