Now and always during cold and flu season , stay home if you are sick . Encourage those you know are sick to stay home until they no longer have symptoms . Since respiratory viruses , such as the one that causes COVID-19 , are spread through contact , change how you greet one another . Instead of a handshake , a kiss or a hug , a friendly wave or elbow bump is less likely to expose you to respiratory viruses . Practise frequent hygiene , which includes proper hand washing and coughing and sneezing etiquette . Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces , such as toys and door handles . These are the most important ways that you can protect yourself and your family from respiratory illness , including COVID-19 . \n Make a plan \n If COVID-19 becomes common in your community , you will want to have thought about how to change your behaviours and routines to reduce the risk of infection . \n Your plan should include how you can change your regular habits to reduce your exposure to crowded places . For example , you may : \n\n do your grocery shopping at off - peak hours \n commute by public transit outside of the busy rush hour \n opt to exercise outdoors instead of in an indoor fitness class \n\n Your plan should also include what you will do if you become sick . If you are a caregiver of children or other dependents , you will want to have thought ahead to engage backup caregivers . \n You should also think about what you will do if a member of your family becomes sick and needs care . Talk to your employer about working from home if you are needed to care for a family member at home . \n If you become ill , stay home until you are no longer showing symptoms . Employers should not require a sick leave note as that will put added pressure on limited health care services . \n Your plan should include   shopping for supplies   that you should have on hand at all times . This will ensure you do not need to leave your home while you are sick or busy caring for an ill family member . \n Your plan should build on the kits you have prepared for other potential emergencies . For more information on how to prepare yourself and your family in the event of an emergency , please visit GetPrepared.ca . \n \n Fill your prescriptions \n Refill your prescriptions now so that you do not have to go to a busy pharmacy if you do become sick . Consider seeing your health care provider to renew your prescriptions ahead of time . \n \n Stock up on essentials but avoid panic buying \n At this time , it makes sense to fill your cupboards with non - perishable food items , so that you do not need to go shopping if you become sick . \n It is easier on the supply chain if people gradually build up their household stores instead of making large - scale purchases all at once . To do this , you can add a few extra items to your grocery cart every time you shop . Good options are easy - to - prepare foods like : \n\n dried pasta and sauce \n prepared canned soups \n canned vegetables and beans \n\n It is also a good idea to have extra stores of : \n\n pet food \n toilet paper \n facial tissue \n feminine hygiene products \n diapers ( if you have children who use them ) \n\n The reason for stocking up on these items is not necessarily because you will need to self - isolate . Having these supplies on hand will ensure you do not need to leave your home at the peak of the outbreak or if you become ill . \n \n How to care for those who are ill \n If you or a member of your family become ill with COVID-19 , there are precautions that should be taken in the home . Your health care provider will advise you if hospital care is more appropriate . \n Children who have mild COVID-19 symptoms are able to stay at home with a caregiver throughout their recovery without needing hospitalization . If you are caring for a child who has suspected or probable COVID-19 , it is important to follow the advice for caregivers . This advice will help you protect yourself , others in your home , as well as others in the community . \n To prepare for these potential situations , you should have on hand : \n\n soap \n facial tissue \n paper towels \n alcohol - based hand sanitizer \n household cleaning products \n regular detergents for washing dishes and doing laundry \n fever - reducing medications , such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen \r\n      \n this includes products for children if you are a parent or caregiver \n\n\n plastic garbage bags for containing soiled tissues and other waste \n diluted bleach , prepared according to the instructions on the label , or in a ratio of 1 teaspoon ( 5 mL ) per cup ( 250 mL ) \r\n      \n this assumes bleach is 5 % sodium hypochlorite , to give a 0.1 % sodium hypochlorite solution \n\n\n\n \n Get reliable information \n Make sure that you get high - quality information about COVID-19 from reliable sources . The Public Health Agency of Canada is a reliable source of information , as are provincial and territorial public health authorities . \n If you are finding that the news media is making you feel anxious , take a break from it . \n \n Communicate with family , friends and neighbours \n Let your family , friends and neighbours know that you are making plans to prepare for COVID-19 . Share your plan with them , as this might motivate them to make their own . \n Talk to them about a buddy system in which you agree to check in on each other and run essential errands if you become sick .", "containsURLs": false, "questionUUID": "4cf30562-7535-11ea-9e8b-3af9d3ce0829", "answerUUID": "4cf3061e-7535-11ea-95cb-3af9d3ce0829", "exampleUUID": "4cf30664-7535-11ea-8e38-3af9d3ce0829", "topic": ""}

Some of the physical distancing measures need extensive preparation . Community planners should prepare for :  \n interruptions in social supports \n reduction in public services like transit and access to community centres \n financial consequences from the reduction of services or cancelled events \n  Planners , administrators and employers must work together to put into effect community - based measures to protect : \n groups \n employees \n the general population \n \n Avoiding crowds \n Respiratory illnesses like COVID-19 spread quickly in crowded spaces . Avoiding crowds can reduce the spread of infection .
